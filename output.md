September 15 2023 News Release | CREA StatisticsNational StatisticsCanadian Home Sales Fall Back in AugustOttawa, ON, September 15, 2023 – Statistics released today by the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) show national home sales were down on a month-over-month basis in August 2023.Highlights:Monthly Housing Market Report   Download dataHome sales recorded over Canadian MLS® Systems posted a 4.1% decline between July and August 2023. (Chart A)


Chart AThe national sales figure was pulled lower in August by declines in Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley, Montreal, Ottawa, Hamilton-Burlington as well as London and St. Thomas.The actual (not seasonally adjusted) number of transactions came in 5.3% above August 2022.“With sales slowing and new listings returning to more normal levels, demand and supply are continuing to come into better balance” said Larry Cerqua, Chair of CREA. “This is giving buyers more time and more choice. If you’re looking for information and guidance about how to buy or sell a property this fall, contact a REALTOR® in your area,” continued Cerqua."August was the first full month of housing data following the Bank of Canada’s July rate hike, so a dip in activity was expected,” said Shaun Cathcart, CREA’s Senior Economist. “The demand is obviously still there, and it will be back, but as the housing affordability crisis re-emerges as a top policy issue, for now, the slowdown on the buyer side should help keep a lid on prices.”The number of newly listed homes edged up 0.8% on a month-over-month basis in August, a small increase following a cumulative gain of more than 24% between March and July. New listings started off 2023 at a 20-year low but are now closer to average levels.With sales falling and new listings edging up in August, the sales-to-new listings ratio eased to 56.2% compared to 59% in July and a peak of 67.4% in April. The measure is now back in line with its long-term average of 55.2%.There were 3.4 months of inventory on a national basis at the end of August 2023, up from 3.2 months in July. While the measure is up a bit from its recent low of 3.1 months in May and June, it remains below the second half of 2022 and well below its long-term average of about five months.The Aggregate Composite MLS® Home Price Index (HPI) edged up 0.4% on a month-over-month basis in August 2023— only about half as large as the July gain, which was only about half as large as the gains recorded in April, May, and June. This levelling off of prices is in line with slowing sales and a rebound in listings.While prices are stabilizing at the national level, regional differences are re-emerging. Price growth has remained solid in Quebec and the East Coast, followed by British Columbia and the Prairies. Ontario is now a mixed bag, still with some of the bigger increases but also some of the bigger declines.As of August 2023, the Aggregate Composite MLS® HPI was up 0.4% on a year-over-year basis. This was the first year-over-year increase since September 2022. Even though prices appear to be levelling out near current levels, year-over-year comparisons will likely continue to rise in the months ahead becauseof how prices continued to decline through the second half of 2022.

Definitions
Builder, has a very specific meaning that is not limited to a person who physically constructs housing. For more information, see Determining if you are a builder for GST/HST purposes.
Co-operative housing corporation (co-op) means a corporation established to provide a residential unit to its members by way of lease, licence, or similar arrangement for occupancy as a place of residence. A co-op must operate at or near cost, at least 90% of the co-op's members must be individuals or other co-ops who hold at least 90% of the co-op's shares, and none of the co-op members (except for other co-ops) can have more than one vote in the affairs of the co-op.
Duplex means a building that contains two residential units under one legal title (separate legal title does not exist for the individual units). This includes a single-family house that has a separate apartment for rent. If the housing is a condominium, it is not a duplex for purposes of this guide.
For the purposes of the GST/HST new housing rebate, a condominium is not a duplex. For the purposes of the GST/HST new housing rebate and the GST/HST new residential rental property rebate, a duplex is a single unit residential complex.
Fair market value (FMV) generally means the highest price, expressed in dollars, that property or services would bring in an open and unrestricted market, between a willing buyer and a willing seller who are both knowledgeable, informed, and prudent, and who are acting independently of each other. Fair market value does not include the GST/HST payable on the fair market value of the property, fair market value does not include any provincial land transfer taxes payable on the sale.
Floating home means a structure that is made up of a floating platform and a building that is permanently affixed to the floating platform and that is designed to be occupied as a place of residence for individuals. A floating home does not include any freestanding appliances or furniture sold with the structure, and it cannot be readily adapted for self-propulsion (it is not a house-boat or pleasure craft).
Major addition, for the purposes of new housing rebates, means work on a house that is so significant that the result is viewed as a newly built house. The addition, by itself, would not be considered to result in a newly built house. Significant physical and functional changes also have to be made to the existing house so that the resulting structure would be seen as a newly constructed house.
The addition should at least double the size of the livable areas of your existing house, which is absorbed into the new one. An example would be making significant structural changes to the appearance and layout of an existing bungalow and adding a full second story.
Mobile home means a building, the manufacture and assembly of which is completed or substantially completed, that is:

A mobile home may include a modular home, but it does not include travel trailers, motor homes, camping trailers, or other vehicles or trailers designed and used for recreational purposes. A mobile home does not include any freestanding appliances or furniture sold with the home.
Modular home means a factory-built house or building intended for residential occupancy made up of modules, with three walls and a roof or ceiling.
For GST/HST purposes, a modular home must be:

In addition, the modules are to be in as finished a condition as possible before leaving the manufacturer's premises, considering that they must be transported. A modular home does not include any freestanding appliances or furniture sold with the structure.
For more information, see GST/HST Policy Statement P-223, The meaning of "manufacture and assembly of which is completed or substantially completed" in the definition of "mobile home".
If a modular home is considered to be a mobile home, then all references to mobile home in this guide include the modular home. In this case, see Modular home, mobile home, and floating home for the options available for claiming a new housing rebate. If a modular home is not considered to be a mobile home, a new housing rebate for an owner-built house may be available, see New housing rebate for owner-built houses.
Participating province means a province that has harmonized its provincial sales tax with the GST to implement the harmonized sales tax (HST). Participating provinces include New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island, but do not include the Nova Scotia offshore area or the Newfoundland offshore area except to the extent that offshore activities, as defined in subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act, are carried on in that area.


Possession, in respect of real property for GST/HST purposes, generally means that you are entitled to hold, control, or occupy the property. For example, if you pay the property taxes, have the right to alter the land, control entry or access to the property, or obtain insurance coverage, you may be considered to have possession of the property. For more information, see GST/HST Memorandum 19.1, Real Property and the GST/HST.
Primary place of residence of an individual generally means the residence that the individual lives in on a permanent basis. An individual may have more than one residence, but is considered to have only one primary place of residence. For more information, see Primary place of residence.
Purchase price, for the purposes of GST/HST housing rebates, means the total amount paid for a new house not including:

Real property includes:

Registrant means a person that is registered or required to be registered for the GST/HST.
Relation of an individual means another individual who is related by blood, marriage, common-law partnership, or adoption within the meaning of the Income Tax Act.
Blood relation is limited to parents, children, or other descendants or siblings. Marriage relation includes a spouse or a person who is connected to the spouse by blood. Common‑law partnership includes a common‑law partner or adoption.a person who is connected to the common‑law partner by blood. Adoption is the relation between the adoptive parent and the individual that has been adopted, either legally or in fact, as the child of the parent or of an individual who is connected to the parent by blood (except a brother or sister). For the purposes of the GST/HST new housing rebate only, a relation can also be a former spouse, or a former common-law partner.
Residential condominium unit, for the GST/HST new housing rebate purposes, means a housing unit that is for use as a place of residence and that is, or is intended to be, a bounded space in a building designated or described as a separate unit on a registered condominium or strata lot plan or description (or similar plan or description registered under provincial law). A residential condominium unit includes any interest in the common areas as well as any interest in land pertaining to ownership of the unit.
For example, an apartment unit or a townhouse would generally be a residential condominium unit for GST/HST new housing rebate purposes if the unit:

Residential trailer park generally means a trailer park that includes at least two site, where both of the following conditions are met:

A residential trailer park includes the land and any buildings and other appurtenances to the land that are reasonably necessary for use by the occupants, or for the operation of the park. If a person has two or more trailer parks that are located right beside each other, the conditions apply to all of the sites, and the trailer parks are considered to be one residential trailer park.
Substantial completion – generally means that construction or substantial renovation of a house is at a stage of completion (generally 90% or more) where an individual can reasonably inhabit the premises. Minor repairs, adjustments, or outstanding upgrades are not considered to impair the use and enjoyment of the house as a place of residence.
Substantial renovation (for purposes of the new housing rebates) – Major changes have to be made to meet the definition of a substantial renovation. In a major renovation project, the interior of a building is essentially gutted. Generally, 90% or more of the interior of the existing housing has to be removed or replaced to qualify as a substantial renovation (90% test).
You do not have to remove or replace the foundation, exterior and interior supporting walls, roof, floors, and staircases to meet the 90% test.
Only livable areas count towards a substantial renovation including finished basements and finished attics. Livable areas do not include garages or crawl spaces. Work done to partially complete a basement but not make it a livable basement does not count toward the 90% test.
For more information, see Technical Information Bulletin B‑092, Substantial Renovations and the GST/HST New Housing Rebate.
Trailer park of a person means a piece of land the person owns or leases and that is only composed of:



Important terms


Determining if you are a builder for GST/HST purposes
Builder, for the purpose of GST/HST rebates, generally includes a person who is in the business of constructing or substantially renovating houses for sale. The house may be on land owned or leased by that builder. A builder may also include:

An individual is not a builder unless they acquired, built, or substantially renovated housing, or hired someone else to build or substantially renovate housing, in the course of a business or an adventure or concern in the nature of trade of the individual. For example, an individual who buys, builds, or substantially renovates a house to use as their primary place of residence is generally not a builder of that house for GST/HST purposes. For more information, see GST/HST Info Sheet GI-005, Sale of a Residence by a Builder Who is an Individual.
A person hired to provide construction services on land that is leased or owned by someone else, and who does not have an interest in that land, is not generally considered to be a builder. For example, a contractor hired by an owner or a lessee of land to build a new house on the land is not considered to be a builder of the house.


Determining what is considered a house for purposes of the new housing rebate
A house, for the purposes of the GST/HST and/or applicable provincial new housing rebate, generally includes a detached or semi-detached single-unit house, a duplex, a condominium unit, a townhouse, a unit in a co-operative housing corporation, a mobile home (including a modular home), and a floating home. It may also include the land around and underneath the house that is reasonably necessary for its use and enjoyment as a place of residence. This is generally up to one half hectare (1.23 acres) and may include nearby buildings such as a detached garage or shed.
A house may also include a bed and breakfast or similar establishment where rooms are rented for short-term accommodation to the public. If more than 50% of the house is occupied by the owner or a relation as a primary place of residence, a GST/HST and/or applicable provincial new housing rebate may be claimed in respect of the entire house. If 50% or less of the house is occupied by the owner or a relation as a primary place of residence, only the part that is the primary place of residence is eligible for rebate purposes.






In very limited circumstances, a recreational unit may be considered a single-unit residential complex, where it is affixed to the land and modified to include the characteristics of a house. For more information, see GST/HST Policy Statement P‑104, Supply of Land for Recreational Units Such as Mini homes, Park Model Trailers, and Travel Trailers.





Primary place of residence
One of the conditions of eligibility for a new housing rebate to be available is that you must buy or build the house for use as your or your relation's primary place of residence.
Your primary place of residence is generally a house that you own, jointly or otherwise, and that you intend to live in on a permanent basis. You may have more than one place of residence, but you are considered to have only one primary place of residence.






If you buy or build a new house in Canada but your primary place of residence remains outside Canada, then your house in Canada would be a secondary place of residence and would not qualify for the new housing rebate.





The following are examples of some of the factors we may consider to determine whether a house is your or your relation's primary place of residence for purposes of the new housing rebate:

To be eligible for the new housing rebate, your intent to use the house as your or your relation's primary place of residence must be evident at the outset of buying, constructing, or substantially renovating the house.
For GST/HST new housing rebate purposes, a house is not your primary place of residence if, for example, your intention is to use the house as your primary place of residence upon some more distant occasion, such as retirement. Further, a recreational cottage or an investment property is not your primary place of residence for rebate purposes. No new housing rebate is available in these cases.
For more information, see GST/HST Policy Statement P-228, Primary Place of Residence.


Multiple buyers
The GST/HST new housing rebate may be available if two or more individuals purchase a house or a share of the capital stock of a co-operative housing corporation, or if two or more individuals construct or substantially renovate or engage another person to construct or substantially renovate, a house, in respect of:

where the house or share of capital stock in a co-operative housing corporation is for use as the primary place of residence of any of the individuals, or a relation of any of the individuals.


Rebates for new housing
The GST/HST new housing rebate allows an individual to recover some of the GST or the federal part of the HST paid for a new or substantially renovated house that is for use as the individual's, or their relation's, primary place of residence, when all of the other conditions are met.






The new housing rebate is only available to individuals who meet all of the conditions for claiming the rebate. However, it is not available to an individual if the individual co-owns the housing with another person who is not an individual.
The new housing rebate is not available to a corporation or a partnership.





Owner-built houses
You may be entitled to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for an owner-built house if you:

For a mobile or a floating home, you can claim either the owner-built new housing rebate or the new housing rebate for a house purchased from a builder, mentioned below.






If you renovated your house or built an addition to your existing house, see Substantial renovation, major addition, and conversion to determine if the work you have done is extensive enough to consider your house as new.





For more information, see New housing rebate for owner-built houses.


Houses purchased from a builder
You may be entitled to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for a house purchased from a builder if one of the following apply:

For more information, see New housing rebate for houses purchased from a builder.


Provincial new housing rebates
One of the following provincial new housing rebates may be available for the provincial part of the HST whether the GST/HST new housing rebate for the federal part of the HST is available or not.


Nova Scotia rebate
If your house is located in Nova Scotia, you may qualify for a rebate for some of the provincial part of the HST that you paid to buy or build the new house (a Nova Scotia rebate is not available for the substantial renovation of a house). For more information, see Nova Scotia new housing rebate for owner-built houses or Nova Scotia new housing rebate for houses purchased from a builder.


Ontario rebate
If you paid the HST to buy, build, or substantially renovate a house located in Ontario you may be entitled to claim a provincial new housing rebate for some of the provincial part of the HST that you paid. For more information, see Ontario new housing rebate for owner-built houses or Ontario new housing rebate for houses purchased from a builder.


Other new housing rebate


GST/HST new residential rental property rebate If you buy, build, or substantially renovate housing to rent for long-term residential use by individuals as their primary place of residence, you are not entitled to claim the GST/HST new housing rebate. However, you may be entitled to claim the GST/HST new residential rental property rebate. For more information, see Guide RC4231, GST/HST New Residential Rental Property Rebate.


New housing rebates for owner-built houses


GST/HST new housing rebate for owner-built houses
For an owner-built house, as previously described, you can claim the GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the GST and/or the federal part of the HST that you paid to build the house if you meet all of the following conditions:







If you are entitled to claim a new housing rebate for your purchase of a mobile or floating home, you have the option to claim either the new housing rebate for owner-built houses or the new housing rebate for purchasers of new housing from a builder. For a modular home, this option is only available if the modular home is considered to be a mobile home. For more information about your options, see Modular home, mobile home, and floating home.





If two or more individuals construct or substantially renovate, or engage another person to construct or substantially renovate, a house, a new housing rebate may be available where the house is for use as the primary place of residence of any of the individuals, or a relation of any of the individuals, provided that all the other conditions for the rebate are met by at least one of the individuals. However, only one of the individuals may apply for the rebate (that is, only one can be the claimant).
The conditions above, except for the $450,000 maximum, also apply for the Ontario new housing rebate.


Selling the house before anyone occupied it
If you made an exempt sale of the house and transferred the ownership to the purchaser before you, or anyone else, occupied it, you may be eligible to claim a new housing rebate if you had originally intended that the house would be the primary place of residence for you or a relation and all of the other conditions for the house rebate, discussed above, are met.
Generally, your sale of a house will be exempt if you are not considered to be a builder of the house for GST/HST purposes and you did not claim any input tax credits for the GST/HST payable on costs incurred to build or substantially renovate the house.
You may be the builder of the house for GST/HST purposes if you had a primary or secondary intention to sell the house instead of using it as your or your relation's primary place of residence. If you are a builder of the house, your sale of the house may be taxable and no new housing rebate would be available to you. For more information, see Info Sheet GI-005, Sale of a Residence by a Builder Who is an Individual, and Guide RC4052, GST/HST Information for the Home Construction Industry.


Nova Scotia new housing rebate for owner-built houses
The Nova Scotia First Time Home Buyers rebate may be available to you if the owner-built house is located in Nova Scotia. If so, you have to claim the Nova Scotia rebate with the Province of Nova Scotia. For more information on this rebate, contact Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations.


Ontario new housing rebate for owner-built houses
An Ontario new housing rebate may be available even if the fair market value of the house is $450,000 or more.
You are eligible to claim an Ontario new housing rebate if you are an individual who paid the HST to build or substantially renovate a house, build a major addition that forms part of a renovation of your house, or convert a non-residential building to residential use, that house is located in Ontario and is for use as your, or your relation’s, primary place of residence, and either:

The maximum Ontario new housing rebate amount for owner-built houses depends on whether you paid the HST on your purchase of the land. The rebate is limited to a maximum of $24,000 if you paid the HST on the purchase of the land, and $16,080 if you did not.


Substantial renovation, major addition, and conversion
You may be entitled to claim the GST/HST new housing rebate if you:







You may also be entitled to claim an Ontario new housing rebate if the house is located in Ontario.





The following information will help you determine if the construction work you did to your house is extensive enough to qualify for the new housing rebate. You also have to meet all of the other eligibility conditions to be entitled to the new housing rebate. See Owner-built houses for all of these conditions.


Substantial renovation
If a house has been substantially renovated, it is generally treated as a newly built house.
Only certain major changes will meet the definition of a substantial renovation. For a substantial renovation, the interior of a house is essentially gutted. Generally, 90% or more of the interior of an existing house is the minimum that has to be removed or replaced to qualify as a substantial renovation (90% test).
You do not have to remove or replace the foundation, exterior and interior supporting walls, roof, floors, and staircases to meet the 90% test. If you do remove or replace any of these during a substantial renovation, the GST/HST paid for doing this or for the removal or replacement is also eligible for the rebate.
Any fair and reasonable method can be used to determine if you meet the 90% test. For example, comparing the square metres of the renovated livable floor space to the total square metres of livable floor space of the house is an acceptable measure of the 90% test. You can also compare the square metres of the floor and wall space of the areas renovated to the total floor and wall space of the house.
Only livable areas count toward a substantial renovation. This would include the main floor living areas and finished basements and attics. Livable areas do not include garages or crawl spaces, which are not considered when meeting the 90% test. Work done to partially complete a basement but not make it a livable basement does not count toward the 90% test. However, if all or part of an unfinished basement was renovated into a livable area, this area would be taken into account in applying the 90% test.
A renovation of your basement, or adding a garage or a deck to your existing house, by itself, would not meet the definition of a substantial renovation and you would not qualify for the new housing rebate.
An addition to a house is not in itself considered to be a substantial renovation, as it is the existing house that must be substantially renovated. For example, if a 700 square foot bungalow is being renovated and a 100 square foot addition is added, the 90% test does not consider the addition. However, if the renovation of the 700 square foot bungalow is found to be a substantial renovation, the GST/HST paid on the addition is also eligible for the GST/HST new housing rebate.


Major addition
You may qualify for the GST/HST new housing rebate when you build, or engage someone else to build, an addition to your house, along with the substantial renovation of the existing house. The work must be so great that the result is viewed as a newly built house.
The construction of a porch, sunroom, family room, or bedroom by itself is not considered to be a major addition.


Conversion
When you convert a property from non-residential use into your house, it is considered a substantial renovation, even if the extent of the work, if any, does not meet the requirements for substantial renovation (as described in Substantial renovation). You then qualify for the GST/HST new housing rebate if you meet all of the other conditions for claiming the rebate.
If you buy a building that was used by a person for non-residential purposes and the building is for use as your, or your relation's, primary place of residence, the GST/HST new housing rebate is available for a part of any GST/HST paid on the purchase and other improvements made to convert the building if you meet all of the other conditions for claiming the rebate.
If you held or used the building as capital property in your business, and you begin to use the building as your residence, you are considered to have sold and repurchased the property and have to pay the GST/HST to the CRA, calculated on the fair market value of the property. If you meet all of the conditions for the GST/HST new housing rebate, you can include the GST/HST that you paid to the CRA, plus the GST/HST you paid in improvements, in your rebate calculation.
If you paid the GST/HST when you first bought the building to hold or use as capital property in your business and you were not entitled to claim an input tax credit (ITC) for all or part of the GST/HST you paid on the purchase or on any improvements you made to the building before you began to use it as your residence, you may be entitled to claim an ITC or a rebate. For more information, call 1-800-959-8287.

Forms you have to fill out for an owner-built house
Form GST191-WS, Construction Summary Worksheet. You have to fill out this form first. It will help you determine the amount of the GST/HST you paid during the construction and it will help determine if you qualify for the rebate. You must fill out this form even if you are only claiming the Ontario new housing rebate.
Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses. You have to fill out this form to claim your owner-built home rebate. If you are entitled to claim a new housing rebate for some of the GST or federal part of the HST you paid, you will calculate your rebate amount on this form. If you are only eligible to claim an Ontario new housing rebate, you still have to fill out all of Form GST191, except for Part D.
If the house is located in Ontario, in addition to filling out Form GST191-WS and Form GST191, you can use Form RC7191-ON, GST191 Ontario Rebate Schedule, to calculate your Ontario new housing rebate.
If the rebate is for a property in Ontario, once you have filled out Form GST191 WS, Form GST191, and if you are entitled to claim the Ontario new housing rebate, Form RC7191 ON as well, send these forms together to:
Sudbury Tax Centre
 1050 Notre Dame Avenue
 Sudbury ON P3A 5C1
If the rebate is for a property located anywhere else in Canada, once you have filled out Form GST191 WS and Form GST191, send these forms together to:
Prince Edward Island Tax Centre
 275 Pope Road
 Summerside PE  C1N 6A2


Sending your rebate claim online
To send your new housing rebate claim for an owner-built house online using My Account, fill out and upload Form GST191-WS, Construction Summary Worksheet, to My Account before filling out the information from Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses. To claim the Ontario new housing rebate for owner built houses, you also have to fill out Form RC7191-ON, GST191 Ontario Rebate Schedule, online. For more information, go to My Account.


Documents you have to send us
In most cases, you do not have to send supporting documentation with your application. However, you do have to send invoices with your worksheet where the vendor did not charge GST/HST on the invoice (photocopies of these invoices will be accepted). You also may be contacted and requested to submit proof of occupancy.


Documents you have to keep
Keep a copy of the completed forms. You also have to keep all your original invoices and the other documents you used to fill out the forms for six years in case we ask to see them.
Only original invoices in the name of the claimant or the co-owners are acceptable. We do not accept photocopies, credit card or Interac slips, or account statements, without the original invoices. We do not accept estimates or quotes as proof. If we ask you to send your invoices to the CRA, we will return them.


When will you receive your payment?
Because all claims are subject to audit, you may experience a delay of up to six months before receiving your payment. The processing of your claim may be delayed or your rebate denied if the forms are not completed in full, the rebate calculation is incorrect, or if the required documents are not submitted with your application.


Filing deadlines: what is your base date
The following three situations will help you determine which filing deadline applies to you if you are filing a rebate for an owner-built house. The filing deadline for the Ontario new housing rebate is the same as the filing deadline for the GST/HST new housing rebate.


Situation 1 – House occupied after the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed
If you or your relation is the first to occupy the house after the construction or substantial renovation is substantially complete, you can apply for the rebate after the house is occupied.
Enter your base date for your filing deadline in Part B of Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses. In this situation, your base date is the date the construction or the substantial renovation is substantially completed.
You have up to two years after your base date to claim the rebate. You can include the GST/HST you paid for the construction of the house and the purchase of the land, or interest in the land, on which you built the house, if any, as long as you paid that tax by the date you file your rebate application.






Hassan started building his house in September 2020. The house is substantially completed on April 30, 2021, and he moves in on May 31, 2021. According to the rule in Situation 1, the earliest that he can apply for the rebate is May 31, 2021 (the day he first occupied the house). However, his base date used to determine his filing deadline is April 30, 2021 (the day construction was substantially completed). Hassan enters April 30, 2021, in Part B of Form GST191. This means that he has until April 30, 2023, to claim the rebate for a part of the GST/HST he paid to build his house, as long as the tax he includes in his claim was paid before the date he files his rebate application.





Situation 2 – Exempt sale of the house before it is occupied
If you made an exempt sale of the house and transferred ownership to the purchaser before it was occupied by anyone, you can apply for the rebate after the house is sold.
Enter your base date for your filing deadline in Part B of Form GST191. In this situation, your base date is the earlier of the following two dates:

You have up to two years after your base date to claim the rebate. You can include the GST/HST you paid for the construction of the house and the purchase of the land, or interest in the land, on which you built the house, if any, as long as you paid that tax by the date you file your rebate application.


Situation 3 – House occupied before construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed
If you or your relation is the first to occupy the house and this occurs before the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed, you can apply for the rebate after the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed.
Enter your base date for your filing deadline in Part B of Form GST191. In this situation, your base date is the earlier of the following two dates:

You have up to two years after your base date to claim the rebate. You can include the GST/HST you paid for the construction of the house and the purchase of the land on which you built the house, if any, as long as you paid that tax by the date you file your rebate application.
However, do not include in your rebate calculation any GST/HST that became payable more than two years after the day you or a relation first occupied the house after the construction or substantial renovation began.






France and Tony started building their house in March 2020. They moved in on June 30, 2021. Construction was substantially completed on November 20, 2021. The earliest date to file the rebate application is November 20, 2021.
France or Tony enter November 20, 2021, in Part B of Form GST191, as the base date, which is the earliest of the following dates:

This means that France or Tony have until November 20, 2023, to claim the rebate. However, any GST/HST that became payable after June 30, 2023, cannot be included in the rebate calculation.





Late-filed rebate applications
If, due to extraordinary circumstances, you were prevented from filing your rebate application for an owner-built home by the applicable deadline, we will consider a request to accept your late-filed rebate application. Such extraordinary circumstances may include: natural or human made disasters, such as a flood or fire; civil disturbances or disruptions in services, such as a postal strike; serious illness or accident; or serious emotional or mental distress. We will also consider a request to accept a late-filed owner- built home rebate application where the delay resulted primarily from our actions, for example if we provided you with inaccurate information.






This applies only for owner built homes. It does not apply if you purchased a house from a builder.





How to fill out Form GST191-WS
You have to fill out and submit Form GST191-WS, Construction Summary Worksheet with your rebate application. Fill out this form before you fill out Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses or a provincial rebate schedule (if applicable).
As all claims are subject to audit, make sure this worksheet is completed in full to avoid a delay in processing your claim or having it denied.


Part A – Claimant information
You have to fill out this part.


Part B – Construction information
Enter the construction start and end dates, the dimensions of the new construction, substantial renovation, or major addition, and the fair market value. Fill out the other parts only if they apply to you.






You are not eligible to claim a new housing rebate for a major addition unless you also renovate your existing house and the work is so extensive that your entire house is viewed as a newly built home. For more information, see Substantial renovation, major addition, and conversion.





Part C – Construction details
This part lists the expenses that qualify for the rebate. Certain expenses do not qualify. A number of these are listed in Part C on page 4 of the form.
In Part C, you have to enter details from the construction invoices for each expense that is eligible for the rebate, whether or not the GST/HST was charged. Do not enter details from quotes or estimates.
For each expense that is eligible for the rebate, enter the vendor's name, the vendor's nine-digit business number (often called the GST/HST number), the invoice date, and the invoice number. If an invoice does not identify the vendor's business number, fill out the line, but do not enter anything in the column "Vendor's business number". Use a tick mark to indicate whether the invoice is for labour only (column L), materials only (column M), or for both labour and materials (tick both columns L and M). You also have to enter the total amount of the invoice.
The last columns are used to identify the amount of the GST/HST paid at the applicable rates.
The following information will help you to fill out Part C:

Use "Others (specify)" to enter the information on items that are not listed in the worksheet.
If you have several invoices from the same vendor, you may add up all the invoices from that vendor and record the information on one line. In that case, do not enter anything in the column "Invoice number." The column "Invoice date" should indicate the date of the first invoice from that vendor. Give a brief description of the property (for example, drywall) or services purchased from that vendor, the total amount of the invoices (including the GST/HST), and the total amount of the GST/HST paid.


Part D – Construction summary totals
Enter the totals in Part D using amounts from Part C. This will determine the amount of tax paid that you will use to calculate your rebate amount on Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses and, if you are entitled to claim the Ontario new housing rebate, on Form RC7191-ON, GST191 Ontario Rebate Schedule.

Use the amount(s) you calculated on Form GST191-WS to fill out Form GST191.


How to fill out Form GST191
You have to file Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses to claim the new housing rebate.
You can only apply for the new housing rebate once for each house using a single application form. You cannot file another rebate application for additional work, or extras done on your house.
Only one individual can apply for the rebate, even if there is more than one owner of a house. For example, if a couple build a new house, only one name of one spouse can appear as the claimant on the application form. The name of the other spouse should appear as the co-owner. The rebate amount will be paid to the claimant only.
You have to fill out all parts of Form GST191, unless the fair market value (FMV) of your house is $450,000 or more and you are only filling out this form to claim the Ontario new housing rebate. In this case, fill out all parts except for Part D.
Be sure that each least one of the individuals who constructed or substantially renovated the house, or engaged another person to do so, meets all of the eligibility conditions for claiming the rebate. If you are paid a rebate amount to which you are not entitled, you are required to repay it to the CRA.


Part A – Claimant information
You have to fill out this part. Only one individual can claim the rebate, even if more than one individual owns the house.
If several individuals own the house, enter one name as the claimant on the first line, and then the name(s) of the other co-owner(s) on the second line. The rebate cheque will be issued in the name of the claimant only.






Lisa and David built a new house. In the box "Claimant's legal name", Lisa enters her legal name. David's name appears on the second line as the co-owner. The rebate cheque will be issued in the name of Lisa.





Part B – House information
You have to fill out this part.
Indicate whether you built or substantially renovated the house for use as your or your relation's primary place of residence. For more information, see Primary place of residence.
The base date for your filing deadline that you have to enter will depend on your situation. To determine your base date, see situation 1, 2, or 3, under Filing deadlines: what is your base date.


Part C – Type of construction and housing
Tick the boxes that apply to your type of construction and type of housing.


Part D – Rebate calculation
If the FMV of the house, including the land, is $450,000 or more, do not fill out Part D since you are not eligible to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the GST, or federal part of the HST.
However, if the house is located in Ontario, you may claim the Ontario new housing rebate for some of the provincial part of the HST you paid to build or substantially renovate your house. If you are eligible to claim the Ontario new housing rebate, fill out Form RC7191-ON, GST191 Ontario Rebate Schedule, and attach it to Form GST191 and Form GST191-WS.

Line G
Add lines A, B, C, D, E, and F and enter the result on line G.
Line H
Multiply line G by 36% and enter the result on line H.
Go directly to line P if one of the following situations applies to you:

Almost all means 90% or more.
If one of the above situations does not apply to you, this means that you paid the GST and/or the HST at different rates. This would be the case if, for example, you paid 7% GST on the land and 5% GST on the construction materials. If this is your situation, complete the calculations on lines I through O.
Line I
Add lines B and E and enter the result on line I.
Line J
Divide line I by line G and enter the result on line J. This result is not a dollar amount. It is a fraction that should start with "0" followed by a decimal point if you paid the GST/HST at different rates. It would equal 1 if you paid the GST/HST at one rate. Enter only the first four digits following the decimal point.
Line K
Multiply the fraction you have on line J by $1,260 and enter the result on line K.
Line L
Add lines C and F and enter the result on line L.
Line M
Divide line L by line G and enter the result on line M. This result is not a dollar amount. It is a fraction that should start with "0" followed by a decimal point if you paid the GST/HST at different rates. It would equal 1 if you paid the GST/HST at one rate. Enter only the first four digits following the decimal point.
Line N
Multiply the fraction you have on line M by $2,520 and enter the result on line N.
Line O
Add lines K and N. Then add $6,300 to that result. Enter the result on line O.
Line P
Fill out line P according to the following situation that applies to you (only one situation will apply):
Situation 1: If 90% or more of the GST/HST you paid on your purchases was at the rate of 5%, 12%, 13%, 14% (where the federal part of the HST was 5%), or 15% (where the federal part of the HST was 5%), enter $6,300 on line P.
Situation 2: If 90% or more of the GST/HST you paid on your purchases was at the rate of 6% or 14% (where the federal part of the HST was 6%), enter $7,560 on line P.
Situation 3: If 90% or more of the GST/HST you paid on your purchases was at the rate of 7% or 15% (where the federal part of the HST was 7%), enter $8,750 on line P.
Situation 4: In any other case, enter on line P the lesser of $8,750 or the amount from line O.
Line Q
Enter on line Q the lesser of the following amounts:

Line R
Enter on line R the FMV of the house (building, land, and other buildings such as a detached garage or shed, that are reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the house as a place of residence) at the time the construction or substantial renovation was substantially completed. This amount should be the same as the amount you entered in Part B of Form GST191-WS.
You may want to get a professional appraisal to support your rebate claim if the FMV of your house is close to, or more than, $350,000. Include the house and land but do not include provincial land transfer taxes in determining the FMV. We may ask for information to support your appraisal.
Line S
If the amount on line R is $350,000 or less, enter the amount from line Q.
If the amount on line R is $450,000 or more, enter "0", since no GST/HST new housing rebate is available. You may still be eligible to claim a provincial new housing rebate if the house is located in a province that offers such a rebate. For more information, see Nova Scotia new housing rebate for owner-built houses or Ontario new housing rebates for owner-built houses.
If the amount on line R is more than $350,000, but less than $450,000, do the calculation and enter the result on line S. Your rebate is reduced when the FMV is between $350,001 and $449,999.
The amount calculated for line S is the amount of your GST/HST new housing rebate.
Line T
You may also be eligible to claim the Ontario new housing rebate if the house is located in Ontario. If you are eligible, complete the calculation on Form RC7191-ON, GST191 Ontario Rebate Schedule and enter the result on line T. Send Form RC7191-ON to the CRA along with your completed Form GST191. If you are not eligible for the Ontario new housing rebate, enter “0” on line T.

Indicate whether you paid the HST on the purchase of the land by ticking the yes or no box.


Part B – Ontario rebate calculation
Line R
Enter the fair market value of the house at the time of its substantial completion. The fair market value has to include the value of the land, the building, and any other buildings such as a detached garage or shed, that are reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the house as a place of residence. Do not include any provincial land transfer taxes.
Lines 1 through 7
Use lines 1 through 7 to calculate the total provincial part of the HST that you paid. You will need to use the amounts that you calculated on page 11 of Form GST191-WS to fill out lines 1 through 5.
Line 1
Multiply the amount from Box 4 on page 11 of Form GST191-WS by 7. Divide the result by 12 and enter this amount on Line 1. If the amount in Box 4 on page 11 of Form GST191-WS is "0", enter "0" on Line 1.
Line 2
Multiply the amount from Box 5 on page 11 of Form GST191-WS by 8. Divide that result by 13 and enter this amount on Line 2. If the amount in Box 5 on page 11 of Form GST191-WS is "0", enter "0" on Line 2.
Line 3
Multiply the amount from Box 6 on page 11 of Form GST191-WS by 8. Divide that result by 14 and enter this amount on Line 3. If the amount in Box 6 on page 11 of Form GST191-WS is "0", enter "0" on Line 3.
Line 4
Add the amounts from Line A and Line B and enter the total on Line 4.

Line 6
Enter the amount of tax that you self-assessed on Form GST489, Return for Self-Assessment of the Provincial Part of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST), for construction materials you brought into Ontario to use in constructing or substantially renovating your home.
Line 7
Add the amounts on lines 1 through 6 and enter the total on line 7. This is the total provincial part of the HST that you paid.
Line T
The amount you will enter on line T depends on whether you paid the HST on the purchase of the land.
If you paid the HST on the purchase of the land
Multiply the amount from line 7 by 75% and enter the result (to a maximum of $24,000) on line T. This is the amount of your Ontario new housing rebate.
If you did not pay the HST on the purchase of the land
Multiply the amount from line 7 by 75% and enter the result (to a maximum of $16,080) on line T. This is the amount of your Ontario new housing rebate.
If you are entitled to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for the federal part of the HST, enter the amount from line T onto the corresponding line T on Form GST191.
If you are not entitled to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for the federal part of the HST but you are entitled to claim an Ontario new housing rebate, you do not have to enter any amount from Form RC7191-ON on Form GST191. However, you still have to fill out parts A, B, C, and E of Form GST191.


New housing rebates for houses purchased from a builder
You may be eligible to claim the GST/HST new housing rebate if you:







Where a purchase and sale agreement for a new house is assigned to you, there may be two builders of the house – the original builder (Builder A) and the first purchaser (the assignor). If that is the case, you would generally have to pay the GST/HST to Builder A for the purchase of the new house and to the first purchaser for the purchase of the interest in the new house. For more information, see Info Sheet GI-120, Assignment of a Purchase and Sale Agreement for a New House or Condominium Unit.





For more information on what type of housing qualifies for this rebate, see Determined what is considered a house for purposes of the new housing rebate
The following information will help you determine if you are eligible to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate and fill out the necessary forms.






If two or more individuals purchase a house or a share of the capital stock of a co-op, a new housing rebate may be available where the house or the share of the capital stock of a co op is for use as the primary place of residence of any of the individuals, or a relation of any of the individuals, provided that all the other eligibility conditions for the rebate are met by at least one of the individuals. Only one of the individuals may apply for the rebate (that is, only one may be the claimant). The eligibility conditions for each of the rebate application types are discussed in the following sections.





Nova Scotia new housing rebate for houses purchased from a builder
The Nova Scotia First-Time Home Buyers Rebate may be available to you if the house you purchased is located in Nova Scotia.






If so, you have to claim the Nova Scotia rebate with the Province of Nova Scotia. For more information on this rebate, contact Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations.





Ontario new housing rebate for houses purchased from a builder
An Ontario new housing rebate may be available even if the total price or fair market value of the house is above the applicable threshold.
You are eligible to claim the Ontario new housing rebate if you bought a new or substantially renovated house (including a new condominium unit, mobile home or floating home) from a builder or you bought a share of capital stock of a co-op, the house is located in Ontario and is for use as your or your relation's primary place of residence, and either:

The maximum Ontario new housing rebate amount that is available is $24,000.


Forms you have to fill out for a house purchased from a builder
Form RC7190-WS, GST190 Calculation Worksheet. Use this form to calculate the amount of your GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the GST, or federal part of the HST, you paid. You will report the amount of your rebate on Form GST190. You do not need to file Form RC7190-WS with us; keep it with your records as your rebate claim is subject to audit. If you are only claiming the Ontario new housing rebate, you do not need to fill out Form RC7190-WS.
Form GST190, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Houses Purchased from a Builder. You have to fill out this form to claim your new housing rebate. You must fill out this form even if you are only claiming the Ontario new housing rebate. If you are claiming a GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the GST or federal part of the HST, you will also need to fill out Form RC7190-WS to calculate the amount of your rebate.
If your house is located in Ontario, in addition to filling out Form GST190 and Form RC7190-WS (if applicable), use Form RC7190-ON, GST190 Ontario Rebate Schedule to calculate your Ontario new housing rebate.


If the builder pays or credits the amount of the GST/HST new housing rebate to you
When you buy a house from a builder, the builder may pay the total amount of your new housing rebate, including the Ontario new housing rebate that you are entitled to claim, directly to you or credit the amount against the total amount payable for the house so that you do not have to apply to the CRA directly and wait to receive your rebate.






Only the builder who sells you the house is authorized to pay or credit a GST/HST new housing rebate or the Ontario new housing rebate to you. If you previously paid tax to a person (assignor) who assigned the agreement of purchase and sale to you (because they, too, were a builder for GST/HST purposes), the assignor cannot pay or credit an amount to you.





If you and the builder agree that the builder will pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate, and the builder does so, you have to fill out and sign Form GST190, Form RC7190-ON (if applicable) and the worksheet. The builder has to send us your rebate application and the Ontario rebate schedule (if applicable). You do not send us any of these forms. You may not file any other new housing rebate application directly with us for this house (for example, for tax paid to the assignor on the purchase of the interest in the house). If you have paid tax to both a builder and an assignor, you may want to file a rebate using application Type 2. See Application Type 1A or 2: You bought the house and land from the same builder.

Builders filing a Type 1A or Type 1B rebate application can file their rebate application electronically. Builders that must file their GST/HST returns electronically can submit their Type 1A or Type 1B rebate application electronically together with their GST/HST return for the reporting period in which the amount of the rebate was paid or credited to the buyer.
To file the application electronically, you can use GST/HST NETFILE or you can use the “File a return” or “File a rebate” online services in:

All other builders that must file their GST/HST returns electronically must send us the rebate application by mail immediately after they file their GST/HST return for the reporting period in which the amount of the rebate was paid or credited to the buyer. Builders with taxable revenues of more than $1,500,000 must use GST/HST NETFILE or GST/HST TELEFILE to file their returns for these reporting periods where they have paid or credited the amount of the rebate to the buyer. Builders may also be required to electronically file their GST/HST returns for other reasons. For more information, see Guide RC4022, General Information for GST/HST Registrants, Info Sheet GI-099, Builders and Electronic Filing Requirements, or Info Sheet GI-118, Builders and GST/HST NETFILE.
Builders should not confuse this filing deadline for the rebate application with the deadline for claiming ITCs or the two-year deadline for buyers to claim the rebate.





A builder who pays or credits you with the amount of the rebate has to make sure that you meet all of the eligibility conditions for the rebate, listed in the following sections, before they pay or credit you with the amount. For example, at the time of purchase, the house must be intended to be the primary place of residence for you or your relation. In addition, the total price you paid for the house before tax must be less than $450,000. The "total price" includes, if applicable, the price you paid to an assignor to have the purchase and sale agreement assigned to you if the assignment was subject to the GST/HST. This is the case whether or not the assignor is registered for the GST/HST.

All claims are subject to verification. The documents you have to send us with your rebate application depend on the rebate application type and are included in the following information for each rebate type.
The filing deadlines are also explained within the sections for each rebate type.


Documents you have to keep
Keep a copy of the completed rebate application form, including the Ontario rebate schedule (if applicable) and the calculation worksheet. You  do not have to submit proof of occupancy with your application. However, we may ask you to provide proof of occupancy later. You also have to keep the original documents used to fill out the forms (such as a copy of the purchase and sale agreement) for six years and make them available to the CRA upon request.


Which rebate application type to use
There are five rebate application types in Part C of Form GST190. Each type has its own eligibility requirements and filing deadline. The eligibility requirements and filing deadlines are the same if you are claiming the Ontario new housing rebate, except for the maximum purchase price or fair market value.






If you bought a modular home, a mobile home, or a floating home, see Modular home, mobile home, and floating home for more information on which application type to use. You cannot use Form GST190, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Houses Purchased from a Builder to claim a rebate for a modular home that is not considered to be a mobile home.





Fill out your rebate application using one of the following application types, as follows:



Application Type 1A or 2: You bought the house and land from the same builder
As an individual, you are eligible to claim the GST/HST new housing rebate if you meet all of the following conditions:







If the total purchase price (including the amount paid for a taxable assignment of a purchase and sale agreement, if applicable) is $450,000 or more, you are not eligible to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the GST or federal part of the HST. However, if your house is located in Ontario, you may still be eligible to claim the Ontario new housing rebate for some of the provincial part of the HST you paid to buy the house.
If you are filing an application Type 1A, your claim is based on the GST/HST paid on the house, land, and related services bought from the builder under one written agreement. If you also paid tax to a previous purchaser to buy their interest in the house (by way of an assignment of the purchase and sale agreement), you may want to file the rebate using application Type 2 in order to claim both the tax paid to the builder and to the person who assigned you the agreement.





Use Application Type 1A if you and the builder agree that the builder will pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate and the builder does so. In this case, do not file a rebate application directly with us for this house. Use Application Type 2 if the builder does not pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate. In this case, you file your rebate application directly with us. If you hired a contractor to build a house on land you own or lease, see Owner-built houses. The contractor cannot pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate if it is an owner built house. If you bought a mobile home or a floating home from a builder and other items that you did not buy from the builder (for example, land or improvements to the mobile home or floating home), see Modular home, mobile home, and floating home for more information on which application type to use.


Filing deadline for Application Type 1A or 2
If the builder does not pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate, you have to file your rebate claim directly with us. In this case you have up to two years from the date ownership was transferred to you to claim your rebate.
Generally, if the builder pays or credits you with the amount of the rebate, you will either sign the application form in the presence of the builder or you can sign the application form in the presence of your lawyer who will send the signed application form to the builder. This is usually done around the time of the closing date for your purchase.
If this does not happen, you have up to two years after the day ownership of the house is transferred to you to get the application form to the builder and have the builder pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate. In any case, if the builder paid or credited the amount of the rebate to you, the builder has to send the rebate application form to the CRA.
For GST/HST purposes, ownership generally means the legal ownership (that is, titled ownership) to the property that is transferred to you on the closing of the sale.


Documents you have to send to the CRA
If the builder pays or credits you with the amount of the rebate, you do not have to send us any documents. The builder will send us the rebate application.
If the builder does not pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate, you have to send us the following documents:

If you do not send in all of the required documentation, your rebate may be denied.


Application Type 1B or 5: You bought the house and lease the land from the same builder
As an individual, you are eligible to claim the GST/HST new housing rebate if you meet all of the following conditions:







If the fair market value of the house including the land exceeds the applicable maximum, you are not entitled to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate. However, if your house is located in Ontario, you may still be eligible to claim the Ontario new housing rebate.





Use Application Type 1B, if you and the builder agree that the builder will pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate and the builder does so. In this case, do not file a rebate application directly with us for this house. Use Application Type 5 if the builder does not pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate. In this case, you file your rebate application with us.


Maximum fair market value
You are not entitled to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the GST or federal part of the HST if the fair market value of your house (building and land) exceeds the applicable maximum. The maximum fair market value is:







The maximum fair market value may differ if another rate applied when the builder had to account for tax on the self supply. To find out the rate at which the builder had to account for tax on the self-supply, see Part D of Form GST190 or contact your builder.





Filing deadline for Application Type 1B or 5
If the builder does not pay or credit you with the amount of your rebate, you have to file your rebate claim directly with us. In this case, you have up to two years from the date possession was transferred to you to claim your rebate.
Generally, if the builder pays or credits you with the amount of the rebate, you will either sign the application form in the presence of the builder or you may sign the application form in the presence of your lawyer who will send the signed application form to the builder. This is usually done around the time of the closing date for your purchase.
If this does not happen, you have up to two years after the day possession of the house is transferred to you to get the application form to the builder and have the builder pay or credit you the rebate. In any case, if the builder pays or credits the amount of the rebate to you, the builder has to send the rebate application form to the CRA.
For GST/HST purposes, the date of possession generally means the day you can hold, control, or occupy the property - that is, the day you start to pay property taxes, have the right to alter the land, take control of entry or access, or pay insurance coverage.


Documents you have to send to the CRA
If the builder pays or credits you with the amount of the rebate, you do not have to send us any documents. The builder will send us the application.
If the builder does not pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate, you have to send us the following documents:

If you do not send in all of the required documentation, your rebate may be denied.


Application Type 3: Co-operative housing
As an individual, if you buy a share of the capital stock of a co-operative housing corporation (co-op), you are eligible to claim the GST/HST new housing rebate if you meet all of the following conditions:







If you pay more than the maximum for the share, you are not eligible to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate. However, if the building is located in Ontario, you may still be eligible to claim the Ontario new housing rebate.





Use Application Type 3 to file your rebate application with us. The co-op cannot pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate.


Maximum purchase price
You are not entitled to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate if the total purchase price for the share of the capital stock in the co-op exceeds the applicable maximum. The maximum purchase price is:







The maximum purchase price may differ if another rate applied when the co-op paid the tax. To find out the rate at which the co-op had to pay the tax, contact the co-op.





Filing deadline for Application Type 3
You have up to two years from the date ownership of the share was transferred to you to claim your rebate.


Documents you have to send to the CRA
You have to send us the following documents:

If you do not send in all of the required documentation, your rebate may be denied.

Modular home, mobile home, and floating home
A modular home is considered to be a mobile home for GST/HST purposes provided it meets certain criteria, including that the manufacture or assembly of each component of the modular home is substantially completed prior to being moved to a site. (For more information, see GST/HST Policy Statement P-223, The meaning of "manufacture and assembly of which is completed or substantially completed" in the definition of "mobile home").
Reference in this guide to a mobile home includes a modular home if that modular meets the criteria to be considered a mobile home.
A builder includes the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of your mobile or floating home, and is commonly referred to as a dealer. A mobile home generally includes qualifying land. Qualifying land is the land on which the mobile home sits and the surrounding land (unless the home is situated in a residential trailer park) that is reasonably necessary for its use and enjoyment as a place of residence (generally up to one-half hectare).
If you bought a new or a substantially renovated mobile or floating home, you can choose one of three different options for claiming the GST/HST new housing rebate. In the case of a modular home, these options are not available if your modular home is not considered to be a mobile home.
You have to determine which option is the best for you (you can only fill out one rebate application):

If two or more individuals buy a mobile home or a floating home, a new housing rebate may be available where the mobile home or floating home is for use as the primary place of residence of any of the individuals, or a relation of any of the individuals, provided that all the other eligibility conditions, discussed in the following sections, for the rebate are met by a least one of the individuals. However, only one of the individuals can apply for the rebate (that is, only one can be the claimant).


Option 1
If the builder (the dealer) pays or credits you with the amount of the rebate, fill out Form GST190, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Houses Purchased from a Builder, Form RC7190-WS, GST190 Calculation Worksheet, and, if you are eligible for the Ontario new housing rebate, Form RC7190-ON, GST190 Ontario Rebate Schedule. In this case, you may be able to use either Application Type 1A or 1B.


Application Type 1A
Where the builder is paying or crediting you with the amount of the rebate, use Application Type 1A if:



Application Type 1B
Where the builder is paying or crediting you with the amount of the rebate, use Application Type 1B if:

If the land is a site in a residential trailer park, do not use Application Type 1B. Use Type 1A instead.
In the case of a floating home, use Application Type 1A.
If you choose Option 1, you can claim a rebate only on items that the dealer sold you. If the dealer also sells you qualifying land under the same written agreement for the purchase of your home, the dealer can pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate for the GST/HST you paid on the land, as well as on the expenses you have paid to the dealer to improve the land (such as building a foundation, adding a driveway, well or septic system, or landscaping).
Option 1 is not to your advantage if you paid the GST/HST to someone other than the dealer for the land or any improvements made to the land, or if you paid the GST/HST on other qualifying items not purchased from the dealer. In this case, see Option 3.


Option 2
Where the builder (the dealer) is not paying or crediting you with the amount of the rebate, fill out Form GST190, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Houses Purchased from a Builder, Form RC7190-WS, GST190 Calculation Worksheet, and, if you are eligible for the Ontario new housing rebate, Form RC7190-ON, GST190 Ontario Rebate Schedule. In this case, you may be able to use either Application Type 2 or 5.


Application Type 2
Where the builder is not paying or crediting you with the amount of the rebate, use Application Type 2 if:



Application Type 5
Where the builder is not paying or crediting you with the amount of the rebate, use Application Type 5 if:

If the land is a site in a residential trailer park, do not use Application Type 5. Use Type 2 instead.
In the case of a floating home, use Application Type 2.
If you choose Option 2, you can calculate your rebate based only on the items the dealer sold you (for example, the floating home or the mobile home and qualifying land, if the home and the land are sold under the same written agreement, and also for improvements to that land).
Option 2 is not to your advantage if you paid the GST/HST to someone other than the dealer for the land or any improvements made to the land, or if you paid the GST/HST on other qualifying items not purchased from the dealer. In this case, see Option 3 below.


Option 3
This is the best option if you paid the GST/HST to the dealer on the purchase of the mobile home or floating home and you also paid the GST/HST to the dealer under a separate agreement or to someone other than the dealer for the qualifying land (generally up to one-half hectare) or for improvements to your land or mobile or floating home.
Fill out Form GST191-WS, Construction Summary Worksheet and Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses, and, if you are eligible for the Ontario new housing rebate, Form RC7190-ON, GST190 Ontario Rebate Schedule. For more information on items that qualify for the rebate, see Owner-built houses. You cannot claim a rebate for any GST/HST paid on furnishings, free-standing appliances, legal costs related to leasing the land, or on services related to maintaining the mobile or floating home.


Bed and breakfast and similar establishments
As an individual who bought or built a bed and breakfast or other establishment providing short-term accommodation to the public, you may be eligible for the GST/HST new housing rebate if one of the following conditions is met:

Generally, short-term accommodation means housing that is supplied by way of lease, licence, or similar arrangement for the purpose of its occupancy by an individual as a place of residence or lodging. The period throughout which the same individual is given continuous occupancy is less than one month.
You also have to meet the other eligibility conditions. For example, to be eligible for a rebate on the whole house, more than 50% of the house (including the bed and breakfast) has to be used as your primary place of residence or that of your relation, either individually or in combination.
If 50% or less of the house that includes the bed and breakfast is used as your primary place of residence or that of your relation, only the part that is your primary place of residence or that of your relation will be eligible for the new housing rebate.
You also have to tick the box called "Bed and breakfast" in Part C of Form GST190, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Houses Purchased from a Builder, or Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses.

Do you know you can reduce your income taxes for the year you buy a home? It’s true. If you, your spouse or common-law partner haven’t owned a home that you've lived in, in the past 4 years, or haven’t ever owned one, you may qualify for the First-Time Home Buyers’ Tax Credit (HBTC). It's also called the Home Buyers’ Amount.  
What's the HBTC?
The HBTC is a federal non-refundable tax credit. It encourages Canadians to enter the real estate market by making home buying more affordable. The purchased home must be in Canada and registered with the appropriate land registry office — in your name, or in your and your spouse's or common-law partner's names.  
Do I qualify as a first-time home buyer?
You may be surprised to find out who qualifies as a first-time home buyer. Eligible people sometimes miss out on the tax benefits. They assume the HBTC only applies to those who've never owned a home. Not so. If you haven’t owned a home in the past 4 years, you may also qualify for the benefits.  
Do I qualify for the HBTC if I claim a disability amount on my taxes?
You may qualify for the HBTC if you claim a disability amount the year you buy a home — even if you aren’t a first-time home buyer. If you help a relative with a disability buy a home to live in, you may also qualify.  
How much can I claim?
You and your spouse or common-law partner can claim a combined $10,000. At a 15% tax rate — the lowest income tax rate — the $10,000 claim equals a one-time $1,500 tax reduction. You can apply the whole $10,000 credit on your tax return, or share it with your spouse or common-law partner.  
This is a non-refundable credit and will reduce the amount of taxes you owe by $750. If you don’t owe income tax the year you buy the home, there’s no benefit to claiming the HBTC.  
What properties qualify for the HBTC?
Almost all types of properties you buy as your main residence in Canada qualify for the HBTC, including:

Homes under construction also qualify. You must move into the finished property within one year of the purchase closing date.  
Before you buy a home or property, look for other money-saving tools or programs like the HBTC. Other Canadian government initiatives include the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and the Home Buyers’ Plan (HBP) Opens in a dialog., which allow you to withdraw money without triggering tax if you follow plan guidelines. When choosing a mortgage, a larger mortgage payment amount and shorter amortization periodOpens in a popup. can also save you money. These reduce the interest amount you pay on the principal.

The land transfer taxes must be paid in full at that time, and should be accounted for when putting aside funds for closing costs. The only provinces that have no land transfer tax are Alberta and Saskatchewan. What is land transfer tax?Land transfer tax is a provincial tax levied on newly acquired land. In nearly every province in Canada (with the exception of Alberta and Saskatchewan), when you purchase a property, youâll be required to pay a percentage of the property value as a lump sum once the transaction has closed. For more detailed information on how land transfer tax is calculated in each province, see our guide below. How do I avoid paying land transfer tax?If you acquire property in Alberta or Saskatchewan, you can avoid paying land transfer tax, as it is not charged by either province.Â 
If you are acquiring property elsewhere in Canada, you can typically avoid paying land transfer taxes under the following circumstances:

Please note that the above list is not exhaustive, and you should always get specific details from your local provincial government or seek counsel from an expert (e.g. an accountant) before determining that you do not have to pay land transfer taxes. Is there a land transfer tax rebate?There are land transfer rebates available in some provinces. In Ontario, for example, there is a land transfer rebate of up to $4,000 available to first-time home buyers. Similarly, in British Columbia, first-time home buyers are eligible to receive a full land transfer tax refund on homes up to $500,000, and a partial refund on homes from $500,000 - $525,000. In other provinces, like Quebec and Manitoba, there are no land transfer rebates.Â 
For more information on which provinces offer rebates and how they are calculated, please read our guide below. Jamie David, Sr. Director of Marketing and MortgagesMay 8, 2023What is land transfer tax? 
Land transfer tax (LTT) is often overlooked when considering the total cost of purchasing a home. All provinces have a land transfer tax, except Alberta and Saskatchewan, who instead levy a much smaller transfer fee. In most provinces the tax is calculated as a percentage of property value, using asking price as a close estimate. Home buyers in Toronto, however, also incur an additional municipal tax.
To help offset the cost, Ontario, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island and the City of Toronto offer land transfer tax rebates for first-time home buyers.
How to calculate land transfer tax
Land transfer taxes are calculated based on the purchase price of your property. Each province sets its own land transfer tax rates, as do some municipalities. Use the calculator above to find the land transfer tax based on your location, or keep reading to find out how land transfer tax is calculated where you live.

Fee #1: Assurance Fees
This fee is only applicable if your purchase price is greater than the value of the property at the time of its last transfer, in which case you would incur the following fees:
â¢ $20 for: First $10,000 of additional declared value
â¢ $10 for: Each additional $10,000 onwards of additional declared value
For example, if you recently purchased a property for $100,000 but its value at the time of the last transfer was $80,000, there will be an additional $20,000 of declared value. Therefore, your assurance fee will be $30 ($20 on the first $10,000 and $10 on the remaining $10,000).
Fee #2: Transfer Fees
When purchasing a property, you will also need to pay a flat title transfer fee, which will depend on the purchase price of your property. See the rates below to find the fee that applies to the value of your property.

The low-down on purchasing a home on leased land


When purchasing a home, unless it’s a condo or apartment, you will also typically own the property on which the home resides. However, this is not always the case.   Another option that exists for homeowners is to purchase a home on leased land - a relevant topic due to the amount of land owned by First Nations Bands in West Kelowna. 



For most people, the idea of purchasing a home on leased land comes with some concerns as there are several important factors to consider with these agreements. However, not all of these differences are negative, especially when developers take extra steps to minimize the potential risks.   How does leased land work? Essentially, purchasing a home on leased land means that you own the home but not the land on which is resides. This land is owned by some other person or entity, such as a First Nations Band. "Lease land should be looked at like a leased property; a contractual obligation is signed between the 'landlord' and 'tenant' for the use of the property given period of time," said Susann Czekus, Sales Manager at West Harbour, a community which resides on leased land in West Kelowna. The leases are long-term, often 50-100 years long. The homeowner must pay monthly lease fees or pay for the lease upfront, and can often negotiate a new lease once the current term ends.   Because the property isn’t being purchased, leasehold homes are often significantly less expensive than a similar freehold home would be, which means that homeowners are able to purchase their ideal home in a location that they could not normally afford.     Leasehold properties are usually expansive and contain several homes within one community. This may grant homeowners access to shared amenities like landscaping, maintenance, pools, tennis courts and so on. These luxuries may be accompanied by Homeowners Association fees, similar to strata fees.   So, why are home buyers hesitant? The main concerns are the lack of equity being built due to not owning the property, the fear of what could happen once the term is up, and potentially significant lease fees. As well, it can be difficult to find another buyer if you decide to sell once the lease is closer to its end.   While there are financial benefits to purchasing on leased land, and doing so may enable buyers to purchase a home and have access to amenities they could never afford otherwise, these concerns are still very valid. Some communities, such as West Harbour in West Kelowna, have taken extra precautions to minimize these concerns for homebuyers.   Purchasing a home at West Harbour West Harbour is a community in West Kelowna on Westbank First Nation leased land. As a well-recognized band across Canada, Westbank First Nation has several leased land agreements, including agreements with large corporations like Walmart, London Drugs and Canadian Tire.   The homes at West Harbour include a 99 year prepaid lease agreement, which means there are no monthly payments necessary. As well, the leases are all registered with the federal government, which means that there is no way that the land can be repossesed by the landowner during the time of the lease.    "Buyers may be concerned that since they do not have fee-simple ownership of the land, the lessor has the right to terminate the lease at any given time before the lease expires," said Czekus. "Here at West Harbour, buyers do not need to be concerned as the lease is a federally-registered, pre-paid lease."  Something else that makes West Harbour unique is their Legacy Fund, which they have created to help ease concerns regarding what happens at the end of the lease. For each home purchased, West Harbour invests $5,000 into a fund which is transferable with homeownership. If the market performs similarly over the next 99 years as it has in the past, then whoever owns the home in year 99 should have access to roughly $3.4 million that they can use to renegotiate the lease or use as they please. "The Legacy Fund is a brilliant way to protect the value of the land and give buyers peace of mind," said Czekus. "With each home purchase, our developer deposits $5,000 into an investment fund. This investment, over the period of 99 years, will grow into a substantial amount of money, so when the lease comes up for renewal the buyers will have the funds to do that. Or, if the community decides not to do so, they will be able to take that money and invest in a home elsewhere."  "This is very important information to know in the case of the resale, as well," added Czekus. "Let's say there is only 15 years left before the expiry of the lease. In a regular land lease situation, the buyer may not even consider buying the property knowing the costly lease renewal is coming up in a short period of time. But with the funds in place, it will be a different scenario." In addition to the fund, buyers at West Harbour can save thousands of dollars in taxes as they do not have to pay PST, GST, property transfer taxes and are also not obligated to pay the new speculation tax. To put this in perspective, on a $800,000 home, the tax savings from PST, GST and PTT are roughly $55,000.  As well, those who live at West Harbour are able to enjoy detached, lakefront homes with access to several resort-style amenities, including an outdoor pool and hot tub, private marina and clubhouse complete with a fitness room and tennis courts.  Purchasing a home is a big decision, so it’s important to do your research and consider all the available options. This is just a brief overview of leased land agreements. While owning on leased land isn’t for everyone, for some it can be a great way to achieve their ideal lifestyle.   If you’d like to learn more about owning a home at West Harbour, contact the sales centre at 250-763-6622 or visit the presentation centre at 1825 Viewpoint Drive, open from 12 pm to 4 pm Saturday through Wednesday.   West Harbour is a lakefront community of designer homes by Troika Developments in West Kelowna, just a short drive away from downtown Kelowna, the Westside Wine Trail and several amenities. The community itself has its own private beach, outdoor pool, fitness facility and marina.   NowMedia sponsored content is written and posted in partnership with participating businesses.

The persons purchasing or acquiring land are referred to as transferees.Effective from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2024, the Government of Canada has implemented a prohibition on the purchase of certain residential property in Canada by non-Canadians. The prohibition is a federal measure that operates separately from Ontario’s Non-Resident Speculation Tax (NRST).  Persons who are subject to an exception under the federal prohibition may not be exempt from Ontario’s NRST. NRST is payable unless all of the requirements for an NRST exemption are met. Further information about the federal prohibition may be found on the CMHC website: Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act.A foreign entity is either a foreign national or a foreign corporation.A foreign national, as defined in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Canada), is an individual who is not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada.A permanent resident means a person who has acquired permanent resident status under section 46 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Canada) and has not subsequently lost that status. The phrase permanent resident of Canada does NOT refer to whether or not you reside in Canada.The expiry of your permanent resident card does not mean you lost permanent resident status. In Canada, permanent resident status can only be lost through an official process. If Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has revoked your permanent resident status, without having issued you Canadian citizenship, then you will be a foreign national who is subject to NRST. For more information, refer to the Government of Canada’s webpage on “Understand permanent resident status”.If you have applied to become a permanent resident of Canada, but you have not obtained that status at the time your home transaction closes, you must pay NRST unless you are eligible for an exemption. If you become a permanent resident of Canada after the home transaction closes, you may qualify for a rebate of the NRST if you meet specific requirements. Please see our Non-Resident Speculation Tax rebates and refunds page.If you are a Canadian citizen who buys residential property alone or exclusively along with other citizens or permanent residents of Canada, you will not be subject to NRST. It is not relevant whether any of the citizens or permanent residents of Canada live in Canada. Whether a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada is considered a "non-resident" for income tax purposes is not relevant for the NRST.A foreign corporation is a corporation that is one of the following:Control of a corporation (for NRST purposes) includes both de jure control (who owns the shares that carry the voting rights to elect the majority of the board of directors) and de facto control (whether a person, despite not having the requisite share ownership, nonetheless has a right and ability to effect a significant change in the board of directors or to influence in a very direct way the shareholders who would otherwise have the ability to elect the board of directors). If the corporate documents are set up such that a foreign entity has the ability to elect the board of directors of the corporation, then the corporation is a foreign corporation.A taxable trustee means either a trustee of:Taxable trustee does not include a trustee acting for the following types of trusts:Types of property subject to NRSTThe NRST applies to the transfer of "designated land", which is land that contains at least one and not more than six single family residences. Examples of land containing one single family residence include a detached house, a semi-detached house, a townhouse or a residential condominium unit. Examples of designated land containing more than one single family residence include duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, fiveplexes and sixplexes. For the purposes of the NRST, single family residences include cottages, cabins and other similar structures that are designed for occupation as the residence of a family, whether or not that family has a residence elsewhere and whether or not the structure is habitable for only part of the year. The zoning designation of the land is irrelevant for establishing whether a structure is a single family residence. Single family residences do not include a residence on agricultural land that is eligible to be classified in the farm property class prescribed under the Assessment Act.Since a residential condominium unit and each of the structures described above are designated land for the purposes of the NRST, there would be a transfer of designated land if multiple units and/or structures are transferred together under a single conveyance. As an example, if two fourplexes are transferred under a single conveyance, there would be a transfer of designated land and the NRST may be applicable. If seven or more residential condominium units are transferred under a single conveyance, there is a transfer of designated land and the NRST may be applicable.The NRST does not apply to other types of land such as land containing multi-residential rental apartment buildings with more than six units, agricultural land, commercial land or industrial land.The NRST applies on the value of the consideration for the residential property. If the land transferred includes residential property and land used for non-residential purposes, the NRST applies on the portion of the value of the consideration attributable to the residential property. Take for example a transaction where the value of the consideration is $3,000,000 and the land contains:In the above example, the NRST would apply to only the $1,400,000 portion.A reasonable self-assessment is required by taxpayers in apportioning the value of the consideration for the purposes of the NRST. Apportionment is only available if the non-residential property is used for non-residential purposes exclusively. The taxpayer must be able to demonstrate that this portion of the land is used for non-residential purposes, such as commercial activity. The apportionment would be based on the value of the consideration that is attributable to the residential property as compared to the non‑residential property, not the square footage of the two.Who pays NRSTThe NRST applies to the value of the consideration for the transfer of residential property if any one of the transferees is a foreign entity or taxable trustee. For example, if a transfer of residential property is made to three transferees, one of whom is a foreign entity that acquires a 33% share in the land, the NRST would apply to 100% of the value of the consideration for the transfer.As an example, Tomoko, Shoshana, and Lieven buy a home together. Tomoko acquires 33%, Shoshana acquires 33% and Lieven acquires 34% interest, with a value of the consideration of $1,500,000. Tomoko and Shoshana are Canadian citizens, but Lieven is a foreign national. The NRST is applied to the full value of the consideration, resulting in NRST payable of $375,000. They do not pay NRST on just 34% of the value of the consideration. The NRST is not prorated to the interest acquired by the foreign national.Each transferee is liable for any NRST payable. If a foreign entity or taxable trustee does not pay the NRST, the other transferees will be required to pay the tax. This applies even if the other transferees are Canadian citizens, permanent residents of Canada or non-foreign corporations.Exemptions from the NRSTAn exemption from NRST may be available for registered transfers if the transferee is a nominee, a protected person or a spouse of a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident of Canada, a nominee or a protected person. Exemptions in the Act and its regulations that apply to LTT also apply to the NRST.Supporting documentation may be required by the ministry to substantiate all claims for an NRST exemption.To learn more, refer to our page on: Transfers that are exempt from the NRST.Rebate and refund of the NRSTA rebate of the NRST, may be available for registered transfers if the transferee becomes a permanent resident of Canada.  If the land purchased is within the Greater Golden Horseshoe Region of Ontario, and if a binding agreement of purchase and sale was signed on or before March 29, 2022, and not assigned to other persons after March 29, 2022, then a foreign national may qualify for the International Student NRST Rebate or the Foreign National Working in Ontario NRST Rebate.A refund of the NRST may be available for eligible transferees if the tax has been improperly paid or overpaid.Supporting documentation will be required to substantiate all applications for a rebate or refund.To learn more, refer to our NRST rebates and refunds webpage.Tax avoidance and offencesAll transfers of land in Ontario are subject to audit.Anti-avoidance provisions will be enforced to ensure the NRST is reported and paid as required. This includes examining circumstances where Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada, as taxable trustees, hold property in trust for a foreign entity. This also includes preventing the use of multiple conveyances to avoid the NRST.Failure to pay the NRST as required may result in a penalty, fine and/or imprisonment.InterestNRST interest is compounded daily and interest rates are reset every 3 months.Interest on an NRST rebate or refund begins to accrue 40 business days after a complete NRST rebate or refund application has been received by the ministry. The only exception is for a refund resulting from a successful objection or appeal from an assessment of the NRST, in which case interest begins the day after payment.An NRST rebate or refund application is not complete until all supporting documentation has been received by the ministry. The 40-business day period does not begin until all information and documentation to support the rebate or refund application has been received. For current interest rates on NRST refunds and rebates, please see the ministry's data page on Tax Interest Rates.Note: Interest on a refund as a result of a successful objection or appeal from an assessment of the NRST will be consistent with the general LTT refunds. For more information, refer to Ontario Regulation 182/17: Tax Payable Under Subsection 2(2.1) of the Act by Foreign Entities and Taxable Trustees and Ontario Regulation 398/96: Interest on Tax Refunds made under the Land Transfer Tax Act.Contact usIf this page or its related pages do not completely address your situation, refer to the Land Transfer Tax Act and related regulations, or contact us by:Request an interpretationTo obtain an interpretation on a specific situation not addressed, please send your request by:All requests for an interpretation must include:FormsMore formsIf you are having trouble accessing one of these documents in your browser:  Updated: September 11, 2023 Published: August 17, 2023   Top

Understanding the Vacant Home Tax
By Mirjana (Mira) Markovic
Find our previous article on this topic here.
Effective January 1, 2023, the City of Toronto and the City of Ottawa both passed bylaws to introduce a new tax for vacant homes/units. These bylaws require residential homeowners to declare the occupancy status of their properties annually. The Vacant Home Tax Property Status Declaration (“Declaration”) shall determine whether the Vacant Home Tax (“VHT”) applies and is payable. Properties that are vacant for more than 6 months in the prior taxation year will be subject to a tax of 1% of the property’s assessed value in the current year contingent to exemptions as defined by the Vacant Home/Unit Tax Bylaw for the City of Toronto. The goal behind introducing such a tax is to increase the supply of housing by discouraging owners from leaving their residential properties unoccupied.
Types Property Status Declaration
 
The chart below outlines status of a property and whether the VHT is applicable.

Vacant with an eligible exemption


Exemptions:



NO




Vacant, deemed or determined vacant


Homeowner can declare property vacant through the property status declaration; a property will be deemed vacant if property status declaration is not completed; a property will be determined vacant if selected for an audit.


YES




Deadline to file the Vacant Home Tax Property Status Declaration
Deadlines to file for the year 2022 are as follows:

(Toronto – February 2; Ottawa – April 30), the seller must file the declaration before closing.
Implications for property transactions, both for purchasers and sellers:
Both purchasers and sellers are obligated to make the appropriate arrangements to file the Declaration. If sellers fail to file the said Declaration, the VHT shall form a lien on their property, and any unpaid taxes shall become the purchaser’s responsibility.
Please note that if a closing occurs between January 1st and February 2nd, the seller is obligated to complete the Declaration prior to the closing because only the seller will know the property occupancy status for the prior year. However, if a closing occurs after the Declaration period (February 3rd to December 31st), the purchaser must submit a Declaration in the following year. In this case, the purchaser qualifies for the “transfer of legal ownership exemption” indicated above.
The seller is required to provide a copy of the completed and filed Declaration to the purchaser along with a statutory declaration at closing confirming the filed Declaration is true and correct.
The bylaw continues to be a work in progress and professionals have noted several areas which have not yet been addressed. Some of these areas include but are not limited to the following: a) The VHT does not apply to tenant property that have a written lease agreement for a term of at least thirty (30) days. What about the myriad properties located in Toronto that do not have a written lease? Does the VHT apply?; b) What about Airbnb? These establishments may be occupied for most of the year however, the leases are less than 30 days; c) What about individuals who are in long-term care or a hospital? It appears that these individuals are exempt from VHT if they are in any of the said facilities for up to six (6) months but if over six (6) months then the VHT would apply.
I except that these bylaws will require further amendment in order to provide more concreate guidelines on properties that are subject to and exempt from VHT.

You’re probably already familiar with the fundamental concept of obtaining a loan to become a homeowner. But in reality a mortgage is a rather complex marathon of financial calculations, comparing offers, and various approval stages.
In this article we’ll explore mortgages in depth, and in simple, comprehensible terms. We’ll go over the mortgage process from start to finish, where to look for the best rates, and the vocabulary you’ll need along the way.

 


   What is a mortgage? A mortgage is a loan that can be used to purchase property, which in turn acts as security for the loan. A mortgage tends to be for a large sum and is usually paid off over 25 or 30 years. When you sign up for a mortgage, you’re agreeing to make regular payments. These mortgage payments are comprised of both principal and interest. When a payment is made, it’s first used to cover the interest, then the principal. A mortgage lets the mortgage lender take possession of the property should you fail to make the agreed-upon payments on time.  The mortgage process Once you’ve decided you’d like to buy a home, the next step is to figure out how to pay for it. Unfortunately, most of us don’t have the cash saved up to buy a home outright. That’s where a mortgage comes in handy. Read: How to save money for a house Before searching for a property, it’s a good idea to get pre-approved for a mortgage. When you’re pre-approved, you’ll know exactly how much you can afford to spend on a home. You also reduce your risk since you’re a lot less likely to make an offer on a home you can’t afford. (I’ll talk about the pre-approval process in greater detail later on.) Once you’re pre-approved, you can go shopping for a home. It’s helpful to make a list of needs and wants. That way you can objectively look at each home when deciding if it’s right for you. Once you find a home you like, you’ll put in an offer. Once your offer is accepted, you’ll work with your banker or mortgage broker (read our brokers vs. banks article if you’re not sure which to go with) to get the mortgage approval. You’ll need to provide documents and information. The lender will then sign off on everything if they’re good and you can remove condition of financing from your offer (if applicable).  How do you know it’s time? When is a good time to buy a home and take out a mortgage? A good time is when you’re personally and financially ready. That means you have a steady job, you’re settled in your personal life, and you’re committed to staying put in the same place for the next five or 10 years. Read: Should you rent or buy? When applying for a mortgage, the lender wants to make sure you can afford it on a monthly basis. The lender does this with two debt ratios: the Gross Debt Service (GDS) Ratio and the Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio. The GDS Ratio looks at the percentage of your gross monthly income needed to cover expenses related to the home: your mortgage payments, property taxes, heating and maintenance fees (if applicable). Most lenders are looking for a GDS Ratio below 39%. The TDS Ratio is similar to the GDS Ratio. It looks at all the same things as the GDS Ratio, however, it also factors in any other debt that you might have. If it’s revolving debt, such as credit card debt or a line of credit, 3% of the outstanding balance is usually used for debt servicing purposes. If it’s an installment loan with a fixed payment (i.e., a car loan, car lease, or personal loan), the payment is used for debt servicing purposes. Most lenders are looking for a TDS Ratio below 44%. It should be noted that the mortgage payments used in these calculations are higher than you’re actually paying. That’s because the payments are calculated using the inflated stress test rate (currently at 4.79%). While the GDS and TDS Ratios include some important homeownership expenses, it’s important to also factor in any other big expenses you may have, such as childcare expenses.  Where can I get a mortgage? There are several routes you can take when hunting for a mortgage, including going to a bank or credit union, or working with a mortgage broker. Bank As you shop for a mortgage, your gut instinct is probably to go to your local bank branch where you have your chequing account. Banks offer a suite of products and it might be convenient for you to hold all your important finances in the same place. And some banks will offer you extra perks for bundling your mortgage with another product. Read: The benefits of bundling bank products That said, if you simply get a mortgage with the existing bank you use for chequing and savings, you might miss out on a more competitive rate that’s offered elsewhere. The mortgage market is very dynamic and it’s always a good idea to shop around. I recommend also checking out the mortgage rates offered by virtual banks (sometimes referred to as ‘direct banks’), like Tangerine Mortgage. Virtual banks don’t have physical branches, and their substantially lower overhead costs typically allow them to offer more competitive mortgage deals than traditional banks, particularly for long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Virtual banks will also sometimes offer bundling deals, so even if you don’t bank with a brick-and-mortar institution, there are still mortage deals for you to jump on. Apply for a mortgage with Tangerine. Mortgage broker Another way to shop around is through a mortgage broker. An independent mortgage broker has access to dozens of lenders and can provide you with unbiased advice. Even if you end up choosing your local bank branch in the end, at least you’ll have peace of mind knowing you got a good deal. Online mortgage broker The benefit of an online mortgage broker is that they likely have access to many more lenders than your local broker would. The more options you have, the more flexibility you get. With multiple lender options, you’re also likely to find a better rate. Not only that, but if you’ve been denied a mortgage from your bank in the past, you can still search for one through online mortgage brokers. Homewise is a digital mortgage solution that helps you find the best mortgage options from over 30 banks and lenders. You’ll get support from a personal advisor at every step of the way, including understanding the fine print of your offers. The service is free and the process is done online, 24/7, in all of five minutes. Breezeful is an online mortgage broker that makes it quick and painless to shop around for different lenders. With an online database of over 30 lenders, Breezeful works to match you with one that best suits your particular needs. You’ll get some of the lowest rates possible, all from the comfort of your own home and faster than your normal, brick-and-mortar banks. Read: Questions you must ask your mortgage broker  Important terms to know Pre-qualification: This is ideal when you’re only thinking about buying a home. A lender will collect basic information about your finances and then give you an approximate figure for how much they’d potentially be willing to lend you to buy a property. Pre-approval: Getting pre-approved for a mortgage is more formal than pre-qualifying. In this stage a lender will verify the financial information you provide them and run a credit check. If you’re pre-approved it indicates that the lender is committed to providing you with a loan, though the final amount they’re willing to lend you and the terms of the mortgage are subject to change based on an actual property valuation as well as market fluctuations. The mortgage stress test: This is a calculation of whether you can still afford to pay your mortgage in the event that rates increase. The results of this stress test will determine your qualifications for the mortgage you’re looking to take and applies to all home buyers, including those who make a 20% down payment on their home. Down payment: This is the amount of money you’re required to pay upfront when buying real estate. The bigger your down payment, the smaller the mortgage you’ll need. The size of your down payment depends on the purchase price of your home. For example, if you spend less than $500,000 on a home, you’re only required to put 5% of the purchase price down. Mortgage rate: This is the interest rate you’ll pay on your mortgage. This will determine how much you pay in interest over the life of your mortgage. Your mortgage rate may change depending on if it’s fixed or variable (more on that below). Closing costs: These are expenses that you’re required to pay out of pocket leading up to your closing date. Examples of closing costs include real estate lawyer fees, land transfer taxes, a home inspection, and movers. It’s a good idea to budget between 1.5% and 4% of a home’s purchase price towards closing costs.  Different types of mortgages Insured, insurable, and uninsurable There are three main types of mortgages: insured, insurable, and uninsurable. An insured or high-ratio mortgage is when you’re required to pay mortgage default insurance that protects the lender. Because of that, most lenders offer their lowest mortgage rates on these products (although this is offset by the mortgage default insurance you’ll pay). An insurable or conventional mortgage is when you make at least a 20% down payment on a home. In this case, you aren’t required to pay mortgage insurance. This saves you money, but because it’s slightly riskier for lenders you’ll most often pay a higher mortgage rate than an insured mortgage. An uninsured mortgage is a mortgage that doesn’t meet the government’s guidelines to be insured by any of the mortgage insurers. Examples include home purchases over $1 million and 30-year amortizations. Because of this, uninsurable mortgages tend to come with the highest mortgage rate. Term vs. amortization A mortgage term is the length of time the terms and conditions of your mortgage are guaranteed. If you have a fixed-rate mortgage, your mortgage rate will remain the same for the duration of the time. The mortgage amortization is how long it will take you to pay off your mortgage in full. The standard length in Canada is 25 years, although there’s nothing stopping you from choosing a shorter or longer term (as long as you can pass the stress test). Open vs. closed An open mortgage lets you repay the mortgage in full at any point during your mortgage term. Because of this, it tends to come with a higher mortgage rate. Open mortgages only tend to make sense if you expect a huge cash windfall or intend to sell your home in the near future. A closed mortgage has limitations on how much extra money you can put towards your mortgage beyond your regular mortgage payments. Because of that it tends to come with a lower mortgage rate than an open mortgage. Fixed vs. variable With a fixed-rate mortgage, your mortgage rate and payment amount remain the same during your mortgage term. With a variable rate mortgage, your mortgage rate and payment may change during your mortgage term depending on changes in a lender’s prime rate. Fixed mortgages tend to come with a higher mortgage rate than variable mortgages since you’re paying for the stability of knowing exactly what your mortgage rate and payment will be.  What do lenders look at when approving you for a mortgage? Lenders consider several factors when deciding whether to approve your mortgage application. They look at your income, down payment, assets, debts, credit, and the property itself. Income Lenders are looking for borrowers with a stable source of income. You’ll need to be able to prove that your income is sufficient to regularly make mortgage payments. If you’re a full-time salaried employee, you’ll be golden in the eyes of most lenders. If you’re an hourly employee whose hours are guaranteed, lenders like that as well. If you’re a full-time or part-time hourly employee whose hours are not guaranteed or you’re working on contract, you’ll typically need two years of income in order for a lender to consider your income (lenders will do a two-year average). For proof of income, you’ll usually need to provide a letter of employment, recent paystub, T4s, and notices of assessment for the last two years. If you’re self-employed usually you can still get a mortgage, however, you’ll need to provide more documentation. Since the income from your own business is less stable than a full-time salaried position in the eyes of lenders, typically you’ll need to be in business for a minimum of two years and provide Personal T1 Generals, Notices of Assessment and Corporate Financial Statements (if applicable) for the two most recent years. Down payment If the down payment funds are from a bank account, the lender will usually want to see a 90-day transaction history. If the funds are from investments or RRSPs, you’ll usually need to provide three monthly statements. If it’s from the sale of another property, you’ll usually need to provide a copy of the signed purchase agreement and a recent mortgage statement (if the property you’ve sold already has a mortgage). If you’re receiving gifted funds, the lender will usually request a signed gift letter and want to see proof that the funds have been transferred to your bank account. Assets You’ll need to provide the lender with a summary of your assets, including chequing accounts, savings accounts, TFSAs, RRSPs, non-registered accounts, and vehicles. Although assets aren’t included in the calculation of your debt ratios, having substantial assets proves to the lender that you’re a responsible borrower. Imagine if someone has been earning $200,000 a year for 10 years, but doesn’t have any assets at all. It would raise a red flag with lenders. Has the borrower been spending every penny that they earn? Debts and credit Debts and credit are related to each other. A lender looks at the types of credit you have, considers the outstanding balances and the payment status and also considers your credit score and credit history when evaluating you as a borrower. This information is found on a borrower’s credit report, which a lender must obtain your written permission to access. A lender is generally looking for a borrower with a credit score above 670 or 680 with no late or delinquent payments. However, if you have late payments, or, in some cases, if you’ve filed for bankruptcy or a consumer proposal, you may still be able to get a mortgage. A lender will usually want to know the reason why you have a credit blemish. If it’s due to life circumstances outside your control (e.g. you got sick or were laid off from work and fell behind on bills) and you can prove you’re a responsible borrower otherwise, you may still be able to get a mortgage. The property The last thing lenders consider is the property itself. This is done by way of an appraisal. Depending on the property and where it’s located, some lenders may use an automated valuation model (AVM) to determine the value of your property. (This is when a lender doesn’t need to visit your property to determine its value.) Other lenders may request a full appraisal. The property appraisal confirms the property is worth what you paid for it. It also lets the lender know the condition of the property.  What to consider when shopping for a mortgage While the mortgage rate certainly matters when shopping for a mortgage, it shouldn’t be the only factor you consider. Are you going to break your mortgage? When you sign up for a mortgage, breaking it is probably the last thing on your mind. But a lot can happen during the standard, five-year mortgage term. If you think there’s a chance you might need to break your mortgage during your mortgage term, it’s a good idea to go with a lender and mortgage type with a lower mortgage penalty. Variable rate mortgages tend to have lower penalties than fixed rate. How will you be penalized if you break your mortgage? If you end up breaking your mortgage during your mortgage term to buy a new home, you may be able to avoid mortgage penalties by porting your mortgage. Porting your mortgage means moving your mortgage with you to the new property. Some lenders have more flexible portability policies than others. One lender may only give you 30 days to port your mortgage, whereas another gives you 90 days. You’ll want to ask a lender about the specifics of its portability policy if that’s important to you. What about prepayments? If you want to aggressively pay down your mortgage, prepayments are a must. Prepayments generally come in three forms: regular payment increases, doubling up, and lump-sum payments. Not all lenders offer the same prepayments. For example, one lender might only let you make 10% lump-sum payments and increase your mortgage payment by 10% per year, while another may let you make 15% lump-sum payments and increase your payment by 15% per year. By choosing the lender with the right prepayments for you, you can pay down your mortgage at the pace you want without incurring a penalty for making too many extra payments.  Final word As you can see, there are a lot more things to consider when shopping for a mortgage than just the mortgage rate. The mortgage process can be stressful, but it doesn’t have to be. After reading this article you should be better prepared the next time you apply for a mortgage. By knowing exactly what mortgage lenders will be looking at, where you should look and what you should expect, the process will go a lot smoother.

Lorne Shuman /  February 26, 2020
What is a Parcel of Tied Land (POTL)?


Many people believe that a
condominium is a tall building with many units and some common amenities. 
While this is true, there are a number of other different
types of condominiums in Ontario.  One unique form of condominium
ownership is called a Common Elements Condominium (“CEC”).  With a CEC, there
is an entity called a Parcel of Tied Land or POTL.  A POTL is a freehold
parcel of land or a standard condominium unit which is tied to a share in a CEC.
  The POTL is “tied” to the share
in the CEC which means that the owner of the POTL cannot sell the POTL
without also selling its share in the CEC.  The
two interests cannot be severed.
With a POTL, each home or townhome
owner typically owns a piece of land and the building on it and also has a part
ownership in the common elements of the CEC.  The common
elements include things like parking areas, access roads, sidewalks, and parks.
As an owner of a POTL, and part owner of the common elements, you will have the
right to use the common elements facilities.  This type of ownership is
often found where there is shared ownership to a waterfront or beaches and
docks.  
As a part owner of the common
elements, you will have rights and obligations.  You will be responsible
for paying your share of the expenses related to the operation and maintenance
of the condominium’s common elements.  Like a highrise condominium, there
will be monthly common expenses or maintenance payments which will be
collected by a property management company which is responsible for the day to
day operation and administration of the
condominium corporation.
As a real estate professional, it
is important to note that when making an offer to purchase a POTL, it is
prudent to make the offer conditional on a lawyer’s review of the status
certificate and related condominium documentation.  The status certificate
and condominium documents will provide valuable information about the
condominium corporation such as the monthly common expenses, the by-laws and
any rules that are part of the condominium.  By making the offer to
purchase conditional, the Buyer will have an opportunity to review the
documents with its
lawyer to determine if there are any issues with the
condominium corporation’s finances, if there are any special assessments or
other issues that might influence one’s decision to purchase the unit.  

Finally,
realtors should be aware that there is a OREA/TREB form specifically for a POTL that
should be used when your client is purchasing a POTL.

EvictionsReasons for evictionThe most common reason for an eviction is when a tenant fails to pay rent. Tenants cannot withhold rent to force the landlord to do something, such as making repairs. The landlord is legally entitled to have the rent paid in full when it is due.If the tenant cannot pay the rent and lets the landlord know beforehand, the landlord can let the tenant stay and pay rent later or over time. However, the landlord is under no obligation to do this.Other reasons for eviction include: If you are experiencing any of the following issues: Learn how to deal with this issue 





If the tenant does not leave





Moving out





Returning security depositsTenants have the right to get their security deposits back, if they meet certain conditions.





Renewing a rental agreementRental agreements can be renewed on a fixed-term or periodic basis as long as the landlord and tenant agree. It is recommended that all agreements be in writing. However, oral or implied agreements are permitted by law. Any agreement that does not require any action from the tenant or landlord in order to renew is a periodic tenancy.

The prime rate is primarily influenced by the policy interest rate set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), also known as the BoC's target for the overnight rate. While these rates are not the same, they are closely related. When the Bank of Canada changes the target for the overnight rate, lenders will generally adjust their prime rates within a few days.

Inflation and the prime rate in Canada: September 2023 update
The pace of inflation growth is a metric thatâs closely watched by the Bank of Canada when determining the direction for its Overnight Lending Rate and, by extension, the prime rate in Canada. The central bank uses increases or decreases to its key benchmark rate as a way to control inflation growth and to keep it within its target of 2%.
Inflation in Canada has been running hot since the beginning of 2022, when the end of pandemic lockdowns and related supply-chain snarls led to considerable supply-and-demand imbalances within the economy. As well, global instability, such as the war in Ukraine, has caused energy prices to spike, which has also put upward pressure on CPI. Canadaâs rate of inflation peaked at a 40-year high in June 2022 at 8.1%. The Bank of Canadaâs rate hiking efforts have effectively pulled the measure back down, but it remains well above the Bankâs target of 2%. It came in at 4% in August, exceeding Julyâs too-high figure of 3.3%. 
While the Bank did hold rates at its last announcement on September 6, it noted that inflation remained obstinately high and reaffirmed its commitment to tamping inflation down to the 2% mark. The next CPI report for the month of September will be published in mid-October before the announcement, so we can expect that to play a major role in the Bankâs decision-making process. 
What is the prime rate?
When you apply for a loan with a variable interest rate, your lender will give you an annual interest rate thatâs tied to the bankâs prime rate. All kinds of loans are based on this rate, including certain mortgages, car loans, personal lines of credit, and even some credit cards. Think of the prime rate as the anchor these other interest rates are based on. As the prime rate in Canada moves up or down, so too does the rate of interest you pay on your loan.advertisementHow is the prime rate set in Canada?
Each bank sets its own prime rate, but the Big Five Banks usually all have the same prime rate. The prime rate is primarily influenced by the policy interest rate set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), also known as the BoC's target for the overnight rate. When the BoC raises the overnight rate, it becomes more expensive for banks to borrow money, and they raise their respective prime rates to cover the added costs. Conversely when the BoC lowers the overnight rate, banks usually lower their prime rates by the same amount. 
Is the prime rate going up in Canada?
As a result of a series of increases in the Bank of Canada's policy interest rate to control historically high inflation rates, the prime rate had also been steadily going up since the beginning of 2022 and into early 2023.
After a conditional pause in rate hikes for most of the first half of 2023, obstinately high inflation and strong Q1 GDP growth incited the Bank to once again resume rate hikes. In its June and July announcements, the Bank raised its key overnight lending rate by 0.25% twice in a row for a total of 10 rate hikes since March 2022, bringing it to 5%. As a result, the Prime rate rose to 7.2%. 
Most recently, at the Bankâs last announcement on September 6, the Bank chose to hold the target for the overnight rate at 5%, citing weak Q2 GDP figures, reduced consumer spending, a softening housing market and a more slack labour market as among the main drivers of its decision to hold rates. However, it did note that inflation remained above its 2% target, and reaffirmed its commitment to driving inflation down to the 2% mark, even if that meant effecting further rate hikes. However, it is too early to tell whether or not the Bank of Canada will need to carry out any more rate hikes in 2023. 
If it does, and the overnight lending rate goes up, so will the prime rate in Canada.
 
How does the prime rate affect mortgage rates in Canada?
There are two main types of mortgage rates in Canada â fixed and variable. When you get a fixed mortgage rate, you agree to pay the same rate over the entire course of your mortgage term regardless of what happens in the outside market. Fixed mortgages are a good option if youâre worried mortgage rates will go up, or if you want to enjoy the stability of paying the same mortgage rate until itâs time to renew.
When you get a variable mortgage rate, the rate will be expressed as the prime rate plus or minus a certain percentage. When the prime rate in Canada goes up or down, your mortgage rate will go up or down by the same amount. Variable mortgages usually come with a lower rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages when you sign up, but thereâs the risk that the rate could go up (or down) during your mortgage term. Many lenders will allow you to convert a variable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage at any time, but you will have to pay the fixed rate as of the time you decide to switch.
Letâs look at an example. If the prime rate is 3.0%, and you get a variable-rate mortgage at prime minus 0.8%, your effective interest rate will be 2.2%.
Example 1: Your original mortgage rate
prime rate - discount to prime rate = your mortgage rate
3.00% - 0.80% = 2.20% 
The prime rate can rise and fall over time, and variable-rate loans will rise and fall with it. To continue this example, if the prime rate were to increase by 0.25% to 3.25%, the interest rate on your mortgage would rise by the same amount, to 2.45%.
Example 2: Your new rate after prime rate increases during your mortgage term
new prime rate - discount to prime rate = your new mortgage rate
3.25%  - 0.80% = 2.45% (new mortgage rate)advertisementCheck out your best current mortgage ratesTake 2 minutes to answer a few questions and discover the lowest rates availableshow my ratesWhat is Canada's current prime rate?The prime rate in Canada today, October 7, 2023, is currently 7.2%.*

* The prime rate in Canada shown above is automatically checked and updated on a daily basis for accuracy. Is the prime rate in Canada going up in 2023?Between March 3, 2022 and July 12, 2023,Â  the prime rate in Canada went up by 4.50%, from 2.7% to 7.2%.
The prime lending rates of most lenders went up as a result of the Bank of Canada raising its target for the overnight rate in an effort to control high inflation. When the Bank of Canada increases its key interest rate, most banks and lenders follow suit and raise their own prime rates.Â 
In its last announcement on September 6, the Bank of Canada held the target for the overnight rate steady at 5%, citing weak Q2 GDP numbers, a slowdown in consumer spending, a softening housing market and increased slack in the labour market as the primary factors that drove its decision. However, the Bank noted that inflation has yet to come down to its target rate of 2%. In its announcement, the Bank reaffirmed its resolve to drive inflation back down to its target goal of 2%, and made it clear that it would not hesitate to effect further rate hikes if they were deemed necessary. If the Bank does choose to raise its target for the overnight rate again, we can expect the prime rate to rise with it. How is the prime rate related to the Bank of Canadaâs key interest rate?When the Bank of Canada raises its target for the overnight rate (also known as the policy interest rate or the key interest rate), it becomes more expensive for banks and lenders to borrow money; so, in turn, they raise their respective prime lending rates to cover their additional costs. Similarly, when the Bank of Canada lowers the policy interest rate, it becomes cheaper for banks and lenders to borrow money. As a result, they lower their respective prime rates accordingly. Why is TDâs mortgage prime rate higher than the mortgage prime rate of the other Big 5 Banks?In 2016, TD decided to change its mortgage prime rate independent of the Bank of Canada, increasing it by 0.15% â other banks did not follow suit. As a result, TDâs mortgage prime rate continues to be higher than the mortgage prime rate of the other Big 5 Banks.compare today's best ratesBank prime rates

           Short Term Rentals - The City’s approach to regulation
        











           Definition of a Short Term Rental
        


A short term rental is defined as the business of providing temporary accommodation for compensation, in a dwelling unit or portion of a dwelling unit for periods of up to 30 consecutive days. Businesses that have been issued a permit for a bed and breakfast are not classified as short term rentals.





           Short Term Rental business licence costs
        


As of February 1, 2020, the Business Licence Bylaw includes a two-tiered business licence category for short term rental hosts. All hosts must have a separate short term business licence for each property they rent out. Tier 2 licensees must obtain a fire inspection for the short term rental property before the business licence will be issued.
Tier 1: 1 to 4 rooms offered for rent = $100 per property
Tier 2: 5 or more rooms offered for rent = $172 per property plus the cost of a fire inspection of $104 per property











           Short Term Rentals in Secondary Suites
        


A secondary suite is a self-contained dwelling unit within principal residences or in backyards. They have separate living, cooking, sleeping, and bathroom facilities. Some hosts may choose to rent a secondary or backyard suite as a short term rental. In this case, the suite must meet the requirements for a legal secondary suite. If being used as a short term rental, the host must have a short term rental licence. For more information, visit on secondary suites Calgary.ca/suites.
Please note that secondary suites are not permitted within a dwelling unit that operates as a lodging house.

What is the new home warranty



By law, all new homes built in Ontario are provided with a warranty by the builder. Tarion’s role is to ensure that buyers of newly built homes in Ontario receive the coverage they are entitled to under their builder’s warranty





 












What it is
Coverage includes financial protection before you take possession and protection against construction defects after you take possession. 


How it works
A new home built by an HCRA licensed builder/vendor is eligible if it meets four criteria under the ONHWP Act (there must be a “home”, “vendor”, “builder”, and “owner” each of these are defined on the HCRA Website. The coverage begins when you sign the Agreement of Purchase & Sale, and remains in effect for up to 7 years even if the home is sold. Each warranty comes with certain limits and obligations on you as a home buyer and owner, as well as your vendor/builder.




Who it protects
Ontario home buyers and owners of Freehold, Contract, Condominium/Condo Conversions under 7 years old. 


Who provides the warranty
The vendor or builder pays the warranty enrolment fee to Tarion as a term and condition of an Enrolment Confirmation. For freehold homes, the fee is payable anytime before the start of construction. For condominium projects, the fee is payable at least 30 days before construction begins. 


























 






 






 








Coverage before you take possession
Your warranty coverage includes protection both before, and after you take possession of your new home. See below for an overview of the warranty coverage.Financial Protection Before You Take PossessionWarranty coverage includes financial protection before yo take possession. There are four main types of warranty coverage during this period including deposit protection, delayed closing/occupancy coverage, condominium cancellations and financial loss coverage for contract homes.

Coverage After You Take Possession
Your warranty coverage includes protection both before, and after you take possession of your new home. See below for an overview of the warranty coverage.Freehold, Contract, Condo Units & Condo ConversionsCoverage for freehold, contract, condo units and condo conversions after you take possession is divided into three different time periods: 1, 2 and 7 year with each offering protection against specific items. To learn more about what’s included in these time periods, visit our coverage page for homeowners.Coverage After You Take PossessionIncidental CostsOccasionally new home owners face incidental costs as a result of authorized repairs to one or more warranted items in their new home or condominium.

Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver | CREA StatisticsReal Estate Board of Greater VancouverStrong sales push Metro Vancouver home prices past July rate hikeAs summer winds to a close, higher borrowing costs have begun to permeate the Metro Vancouver housing market in predictable ways, with price gains cooling and sales slowing along the typical seasonal pattern.The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver (REBGV) reports that residential home sales in the region totalled 2,296 in August 2023, a 21.4 per cent increase from the 1,892 sales recorded in August 2022. This was 13.8 per cent below the 10-year seasonal average (2,663).“It’s been an interesting spring and summer market, to say the least. Borrowing costs are fluctuating around the highest levels we’ve seen in over ten years, yet Metro Vancouver’s housing market bucked many pundits’ predictions of a major slowdown, instead posting relatively strong sales numbers and year-to-date price gains north of eight per cent, regardless of home type.” States Andrew Lis, REBGV director of economics and data analysis.There were 3,943 detached, attached and apartment properties newly listed for sale on the Multiple Listing Service® (MLS®) in Metro Vancouver in August 2023. This represents an 18.1 per cent increase compared to the 3,340 homes listed in August 2022. This was 5.3 per cent below the 10-year seasonal average (4,164).The total number of homes currently listed for sale on the MLS® system in Metro Vancouver is 10,082, a 0.2 per cent decrease compared to August 2022 (10,099). This was 13.4 per cent below the 10-year seasonal average (11,647).Across all detached, attached and apartment property types, the sales-to-active listings ratio for August 2023 is 23.9 per cent. By property type, the ratio is 14.2 per cent for detached homes, 30.3 per cent for townhomes, and 31.9 per cent for apartments.Analysis of the historical data suggests downward pressure on home prices occurs when the ratio dips below 12 per cent for a sustained period, while home prices often experience upward pressure when it surpasses 20 per cent over several months.“It’s a bit of a tortoise and hare story this year, with sales starting the year slowly while prices increased due to low inventory levels,” Lis said. “As fall approaches, sales have caught up with the price gains, but both metrics are now slowing to a pace that is more in-line with historical seasonal patterns, and with what one might expect given that borrowing costs are where they are.”The MLS® Home Price Index composite benchmark price for all residential properties in Metro Vancouver is currently $1,208,400. This represents a 2.5 per cent increase over August 2022 and a 0.2 per cent decrease compared to July 2023.Sales of detached homes in August 2023 reached 591, a 13.2 per cent increase from the 522 detached sales recorded in August 2022. The benchmark price for a detached home is $2,018,500. This represents a 3.3 per cent increase from August 2022 and a 0.3 per cent increase compared to July 2023.Sales of apartment homes reached 1,270 in August 2023, a 27.4 per cent increase compared to the 997 sales in August 2022. The benchmark price of an apartment home is $770,000. This represents a 4.4 per cent increase from August 2022 and a 0.2 per cent decrease compared to July 2023.Attached home sales in August 2023 totalled 422, an 18.9 per cent increase compared to the 355 sales in August 2022. The benchmark price of an attached home is $1,103,900. This represents a 3.9 per cent increase from August 2022 and a 0.1 per cent decrease compared to July 2023.Areas covered by the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver include: Bowen Island, Burnaby, Coquitlam, Maple Ridge, New Westminster, North Vancouver, Pitt Meadows, Port Coquitlam, Port Moody, Richmond, South Delta, Squamish, Sunshine Coast, Vancouver, West Vancouver, and Whistler.REBGV is now including multifamily and land sales and listings in this monthly report. Previously, we only included detached, attached, and apartment sales, and these additional categories, which typically account for roughly one to two per cent of total MLS® activity per month, are being included for completeness in our reporting.BOARD & ASSOCIATION INFORMATION

Canadian Housing Market Report Sep. 15th, 2023 | Interactive Map - WOWA.ca  WOWA.caSearchBest Mortgage Rates3-Year FixedCheck More Rates (40+ Lenders) Canadian Housing Market NewsThis Page's Content Was Last Updated: September 15, 2023 WOWA Trusted and Transparent Note: Data sourced from the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA)Canadian Housing Market Data for August 2023Best 5-Year Fixed Mortgage Rates in Canada  Mortgage Term:1-Yr2-Yr3-Yr4-Yr5-Yr FixedVariableSee More RatesAverage Home Prices by Province (August 2023)Home prices are falling across the country, with average home prices taking a dip in seven provinces this month compared to the previous month, while three provinces managed to defy the trend and experienced a slight price hike.Yet, when we look at the bigger picture, home prices have increased on an annual basis in nine provinces, while only one province, Saskatchewan, sees a decline on an annual basis. Let's dive deeper into the latest Canada housing market update for August 2023.CanadaCanada Market ConditionsBalancedThis Month’s SNLR: 56%An SNLR between 40% and 60% indicates a balanced market.The national average home price in August 2023 was $650,140, a 3% decrease from last month and up by 2% year-over-year. That reflects the home price trends seen in most of the provinces this month: a monthly decrease and an annual increase in home prices.Nationally, there were 38,345 home sales during the month of August 2023, almost unchanged year-over-year. Canada’s MLS Benchmark Price, which measures the price of a “typical” home in Canada, was $750,100 in August 2023. That’s only the second time that Canada’s benchmark home price has decreased on a monthly basis since the start of the year.Falling home prices, in some areas of the country, can be attributed to Bank of Canada rate hikes in both June and July 2023, resulting in a cumulative rise in interest rates by 50 basis points. This made borrowing more expensive, including the cost of mortgages, which reduces demand for homes as affordability decreases. Decreasing demand due to higher interest rates has a downward impact on Canadian home prices.For the month of August 2023, Canada’s sales-to-new-listings ratio (SNLR) was 56.2%. SNLR measures the balance between buyers and sellers in a market. A ratio below 40% is considered a buyer’s market, while an SNLR above 60% indicates a seller’s market.The current 56.2% SNLR means that there is slightly more competition among buyers for properties than what would be expected if it were an even balance between buyers and sellers, but it’s not necessarily a seller’s market yet. Instead, Canada’s SNLR has been decreasing on a monthly basis since April 2023, when it reached 67.4%.Canada: Seller’s or Buyer’s Markets?ProvinceSales-to-New-Listings Ratio (SNLR)Market TypeAlberta77%Seller’s MarketSaskatchewan72%Seller’s MarketManitoba71%Seller’s MarketOntario47%Balanced MarketQuebec60%Seller’s MarketNova Scotia73%Seller’s MarketPEI60%Seller’s MarketNewfoundland71%Seller’s MarketOntarioOntario Market ConditionsBalancedThis Month’s SNLR: 47%An SNLR between 40% and 60% indicates a balanced market.Canada’s largest housing market is on the edge of breaking even this month, as Ontario home prices hover around the same level as last year. The average home price in Ontario was $832,376 in August 2023, a 2.8% decrease since last month and 0.3% increase from last year.The average home sold price in the GTA was $1,082,496 for August 2023, representing an increase of 0.3% year-over-year but a decrease of 3% month-over-month. This means that the GTA’s performance is exactly matching the performance of the provincial average this month. GTA home sales are down 6% year-over-year, with 5,294 transactions in July. That makes up 14% of all home sales in Canada this month. That’s up from the 13% of all Canadian home sales that the GTA accounted for last month.When it comes to the housing market in Ontario, let's take a closer look at some interesting trends. Hamilton's housing market witnessed a 1% year-over-year increase in average home prices, while Brampton experienced a slight 0.5% annual decrease. Meanwhile, Oshawa saw a promising 2% rise in average home prices, while Mississauga had a 2% decrease. On the other hand, Ottawa's housing market celebrated a 1% year-over-year increase, and London experienced a solid 2% growth in average sold prices. These major cities are all seeing price movements of between -2% and 2% annually.British ColumbiaIn August 2023, the housing market in British Columbia experienced a slight decline, with home prices dropping by 1% on a monthly basis to an average home price of $958,424. However, despite this decrease, prices remained 5% higher compared to the previous year. Not surprisingly, the average BC home price is the highest in the entire country. Greater Vancouver's average home price for August 2023 was $1,283,729, up 7% year-over-year. This makes Vancouver the most expensive city to buy a home in Canada.QuebecQuebec Market ConditionsSeller's MarketThis Month’s SNLR: 60%An SNLR above 60% indicates a market that favours sellers.Quebec saw a slight decrease in home prices this month.

It analyzes both new and resale properties in the census metropolitan areas (CMAs) of Montréal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, and Victoria. The national composite is the weighted average of all the areas measured by the index. The index is relative to a standard of 100 set in 2017.RPPI for All Residential PropertiesPrices for residential properties in Montréal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, and Victoria continue to skyrocket as prices increase across Canada by 13.8% year-over-year in Q4 2021. The biggest increases were seen in Victoria, where home prices have risen by 18.3% compared to Q3 2019. Meanwhile, Ottawa has seen home prices increase by 16.3% year-over-year. The capital city’s housing market is expected to remain strong due to its economic stability and high availability of government jobs. Montreal and Toronto also remained hot with 14.5% and 14.6% increases respectively. Calgary, on the other hand, was the worst-performing major housing market in Canada, with a 9.3% increase in prices year-over-year.RPPI for Condominium ApartmentsAverage prices for condo apartments in Montréal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, and Victoria increased by 8.6% in Q4 2021 compared to Q4 2020. This growth lags behind the overall average of 13.8% for all property types. The biggest increases were seen in Victoria, where prices have risen by 15.1% compared to Q4 2020. Montreal is second with year-over-year increases of 10% despite the impact of COVID-19. Even Vancouver, where properties stagnated in 2018 and 2019 due to their Empty Homes Tax and Speculation taxes, is experiencing a revival in its condo market. In contrast, Calgary faced a year-over-year increase of just 0.7%.New Housing Price IndexThe New Housing Price Index (NHPI) is a housing price index published by Statistics Canada that measures the change over time in selling prices of new residential properties. It is published by Statistics Canada and used by governmental agencies, market analysts, and real estate businesses. The index is relative to a standard of 100 set in 2017.Real Estate in CanadaReal Estate Transactions in CanadaIn 2019, residential real estate transactions in Canada reached 486,800, a 6.2% increase from a five-year low recorded in 2018. The number reflects increased activity in Ontario and Quebec, where activity was up by 9% and 11% respectively.Real Estate AgentsReal estate agents in Canada are licensed professionals who help home buyers and home sellers navigate the real estate market and conduct real estate transactions. Most real estate agents are part of the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), a professional association that oversees real estate markets nationally. You might be familiar with their trademarks: MLS® and Multiple Listing Service®.In Canada, there are over 130,000 real estate agents across all the provinces and territories. Ontario has the most agents out of any province with 79,000 agents across 38 local rea estate boards. Of those 79,000 agents, over 56,000 are part of the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TREB). British Columbia is second with 23,000 real estate agents and 11 real estate boards.Real estate agents are regulated on a provincial-level. Each province has their own regulatory board that sets regulations for and oversees the conduct of real estate agents in the province. In Ontario, the Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) regulates real estate transactions and helps resolve complaints against real estate agents. In B.C., the Real Estate Council of British Columbia (RECBC) regulates real estate transactions and helps resolve complaints against real estate agents. Other notable councils include RECA (Alberta), SREC (Saskatchewan), and OACIQ (Quebec).Other Real Estate StatisticsHomeownership Rate: 67.8% (2016) Vacancy Rate: 3.2% (2020) Housing ConstructionHousing Starts: 63,720 units (Q4 2020)Housing Under Construction: 292,109 units (Q4 2020)Housing Completions: 50,938 units (Q4 2020) Investment in Residential Construction: CAD $11.1 billion (Q4 2020)Investment in Non-Residential Construction: CAD $4.4 billion (Q4 2020)Average Rent for a 2-Bedroom UnitAs reported by Statistics Canada and the CMHCRegionAverage Rent for a 2-Bedroom UnitGreater Toronto Area, ON$1,622 (2020)Ottawa, ON$1,517 (2020)Vancouver, BC$1,792 (2020)Victoria, BC$1,507 (2020)Quebec City, QC$899 (2020)Montreal, QC$903 (2020)Edmonton, AB$1,272 (2020)Calgary, AB$1,323 (2020)Winnipeg, MB$1,262 (2020)Saskatoon, SK$1,166 (2020)Halifax, NS$1,255 (2020)Best 5-Year Fixed Mortgage Rates in Canada  Select: Term1-Yr2-Yr3-Yr4-Yr5-Yr FixedVariableSee More RatesGlossary and DefinitionsMLS® HPI: The MLS® Home Price Index (HPI) is an index by the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) that tracks the prices of homes in a neighborhood. It allows Canadians to quickly compare home prices across Canada and between periods of time without having to account for specific features of a property. Unlike market prices, which can fluctuate from month to month based on seasonal dynamics, the HPI provides a stable view tracks trends across a longer period of time. The HPI is reviewed every year in May to adjust for changes in the real estate marketplace.MLS® HPI Benchmark Price: The MLS® Home Price Index (HPI) Benchmark Price is the HPI translated into a real-world price number.Strata Insurance: Strata insurance is insurance used by a strata like a condominium to covers damages to common areas and assets and liability to the strata. It can also include fixtures built or installed as part of the original construction of each unit, even though these may not be common structures. The insurance can cover:Strata insurance does not usually include personal items and appliances that are part of a condo unit. It also does not cover the damages made by individual unit owners, such as in the case of water damage caused by a unit owner. These are usually covered by personal condo insurance.Property typesDetached home: A detached home is your standard single-family home. It is a residential building that stands alone and is separately titled or legally a single unit.Semi-detached home: A semi-detached home is similar to a detached home, except it shares a wall with another home. This pair of homes must make up an independent building and each should be separately titled or legally two separate units. There can only be two homes in a semi-detached building.Townhouses: A townhouse is the middle between a detached/semi-detached home and a condo apartment. Like detached and semi-detached homes, they are often single-family units that have their own land and may be attached to other units. However, like condo apartments, they typically have to pay co-ownership fees for maintenance and may share some common features with their neighbors.Condo apartment: This category includes all apartments and condominiums. These are complexes of residential units with common areas such as hallways, parking lots, stairwells, etc. They can be low-rise, mid-rise, or high-rise buildings. Unlike townhouses, there are no parts of the lot (the land of the building) where access is reserved for only one owner or occupant. There can be privately owned units and spaces inside the building.Plexes are multi-story buildings with two to four individual units, usually one on each floor. They are a mainstay in Montreal and other cities in Quebec. Each unit is usually individually accessible via an external entrance with higher floors connected by staircases.Property ClassesFreeholds: A freehold is any property where the owner owns both the house and the land it is built on. Common freehold property types include: detached, semi-detached, some townhouses, and farmland.Condominiums: A condominium or condo is any property where the owner owns the home (or unit) but shares ownership of the land and other improvements with a condominium corporation. Common condominium property types include condo apartments and some townhouses.Leasehold: Leasehold describes the situation where different entities own the land and the structure built on the land. Owner of the buildings has leased the land and pay rent to their landlord while owning the building on the land.Data sourced from the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) and regional real estate boards.

(Chart A)


Chart AThe national sales figure was pulled lower in August by declines in Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley, Montreal, Ottawa, Hamilton-Burlington as well as London and St. Thomas.The actual (not seasonally adjusted) number of transactions came in 5.3% above August 2022.“With sales slowing and new listings returning to more normal levels, demand and supply are continuing to come into better balance” said Larry Cerqua, Chair of CREA. “This is giving buyers more time and more choice. If you’re looking for information and guidance about how to buy or sell a property this fall, contact a REALTOR® in your area,” continued Cerqua."August was the first full month of housing data following the Bank of Canada’s July rate hike, so a dip in activity was expected,” said Shaun Cathcart, CREA’s Senior Economist. “The demand is obviously still there, and it will be back, but as the housing affordability crisis re-emerges as a top policy issue, for now, the slowdown on the buyer side should help keep a lid on prices.”The number of newly listed homes edged up 0.8% on a month-over-month basis in August, a small increase following a cumulative gain of more than 24% between March and July. New listings started off 2023 at a 20-year low but are now closer to average levels.With sales falling and new listings edging up in August, the sales-to-new listings ratio eased to 56.2% compared to 59% in July and a peak of 67.4% in April. The measure is now back in line with its long-term average of 55.2%.There were 3.4 months of inventory on a national basis at the end of August 2023, up from 3.2 months in July. While the measure is up a bit from its recent low of 3.1 months in May and June, it remains below the second half of 2022 and well below its long-term average of about five months.The Aggregate Composite MLS® Home Price Index (HPI) edged up 0.4% on a month-over-month basis in August 2023— only about half as large as the July gain, which was only about half as large as the gains recorded in April, May, and June. This levelling off of prices is in line with slowing sales and a rebound in listings.While prices are stabilizing at the national level, regional differences are re-emerging. Price growth has remained solid in Quebec and the East Coast, followed by British Columbia and the Prairies. Ontario is now a mixed bag, still with some of the bigger increases but also some of the bigger declines.As of August 2023, the Aggregate Composite MLS® HPI was up 0.4% on a year-over-year basis. This was the first year-over-year increase since September 2022. Even though prices appear to be levelling out near current levels, year-over-year comparisons will likely continue to rise in the months ahead becauseof how prices continued to decline through the second half of 2022.

For more information, see the Revenu Québec publication IN-203 V, General Information Concerning the QST and the GST/HST, or call 1-800-567-4692. If you are an SLFI go to Financial institutions.

Definitions
Builder, has a very specific meaning that is not limited to a person who physically constructs housing. For more information, see Determining if you are a builder for GST/HST purposes.
Co-operative housing corporation (co-op) means a corporation established to provide a residential unit to its members by way of lease, licence, or similar arrangement for occupancy as a place of residence. A co-op must operate at or near cost, at least 90% of the co-op's members must be individuals or other co-ops who hold at least 90% of the co-op's shares, and none of the co-op members (except for other co-ops) can have more than one vote in the affairs of the co-op.
Duplex means a building that contains two residential units under one legal title (separate legal title does not exist for the individual units). This includes a single-family house that has a separate apartment for rent. If the housing is a condominium, it is not a duplex for purposes of this guide.
For the purposes of the GST/HST new housing rebate, a condominium is not a duplex. For the purposes of the GST/HST new housing rebate and the GST/HST new residential rental property rebate, a duplex is a single unit residential complex.
Fair market value (FMV) generally means the highest price, expressed in dollars, that property or services would bring in an open and unrestricted market, between a willing buyer and a willing seller who are both knowledgeable, informed, and prudent, and who are acting independently of each other. Fair market value does not include the GST/HST payable on the fair market value of the property, fair market value does not include any provincial land transfer taxes payable on the sale.
Floating home means a structure that is made up of a floating platform and a building that is permanently affixed to the floating platform and that is designed to be occupied as a place of residence for individuals. A floating home does not include any freestanding appliances or furniture sold with the structure, and it cannot be readily adapted for self-propulsion (it is not a house-boat or pleasure craft).
Major addition, for the purposes of new housing rebates, means work on a house that is so significant that the result is viewed as a newly built house. The addition, by itself, would not be considered to result in a newly built house. Significant physical and functional changes also have to be made to the existing house so that the resulting structure would be seen as a newly constructed house.
The addition should at least double the size of the livable areas of your existing house, which is absorbed into the new one. An example would be making significant structural changes to the appearance and layout of an existing bungalow and adding a full second story.
Mobile home means a building, the manufacture and assembly of which is completed or substantially completed, that is:

equipped with complete plumbing, electrical, and heating facilities
designed to be moved to a site for installation on a foundation and connection to service facilities
to be occupied as a place of residence

A mobile home may include a modular home, but it does not include travel trailers, motor homes, camping trailers, or other vehicles or trailers designed and used for recreational purposes. A mobile home does not include any freestanding appliances or furniture sold with the home.
Modular home means a factory-built house or building intended for residential occupancy made up of modules, with three walls and a roof or ceiling.
For GST/HST purposes, a modular home must be:

equipped with complete plumbing, electrical, and heating facilities
designed to be moved to a site for installation on a foundation and connected to service facilities
used as a place of residence

In addition, the modules are to be in as finished a condition as possible before leaving the manufacturer's premises, considering that they must be transported. A modular home does not include any freestanding appliances or furniture sold with the structure.
For more information, see GST/HST Policy Statement P-223, The meaning of "manufacture and assembly of which is completed or substantially completed" in the definition of "mobile home".
If a modular home is considered to be a mobile home, then all references to mobile home in this guide include the modular home. In this case, see Modular home, mobile home, and floating home for the options available for claiming a new housing rebate. If a modular home is not considered to be a mobile home, a new housing rebate for an owner-built house may be available, see New housing rebate for owner-built houses.
Participating province means a province that has harmonized its provincial sales tax with the GST to implement the harmonized sales tax (HST). Participating provinces include New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Prince Edward Island, but do not include the Nova Scotia offshore area or the Newfoundland offshore area except to the extent that offshore activities, as defined in subsection 123(1) of the Excise Tax Act, are carried on in that area.


Possession, in respect of real property for GST/HST purposes, generally means that you are entitled to hold, control, or occupy the property. For example, if you pay the property taxes, have the right to alter the land, control entry or access to the property, or obtain insurance coverage, you may be considered to have possession of the property. For more information, see GST/HST Memorandum 19.1, Real Property and the GST/HST.
Primary place of residence of an individual generally means the residence that the individual lives in on a permanent basis. An individual may have more than one residence, but is considered to have only one primary place of residence. For more information, see Primary place of residence.
Purchase price, for the purposes of GST/HST housing rebates, means the total amount paid for a new house not including:

any GST/HST payable for the purchase
if the builder credited the new housing rebate reducing the total amount payable for the house, the amount of the rebate by which the builder reduced the amount payable
land transfer taxes or any provincial sales tax that may be payable by the purchaser
fees charged by persons other than the builder, such as lawyer’s fees or survey costs paid to appraisers
payments for goods and services paid directly to trade contractors other than the builder, even if these goods and services relate directly to the unit

Real property includes:

a mobile home or floating home and any leasehold or ownership interest in such property
in Quebec, immovable property and every lease of such property
in any other place in Canada, all land, buildings of a permanent nature, and any interest in real property

Registrant means a person that is registered or required to be registered for the GST/HST.
Relation of an individual means another individual who is related by blood, marriage, common-law partnership, or adoption within the meaning of the Income Tax Act.
Blood relation is limited to parents, children, or other descendants or siblings. Marriage relation includes a spouse or a person who is connected to the spouse by blood. Common‑law partnership includes a common‑law partner or adoption.a person who is connected to the common‑law partner by blood. Adoption is the relation between the adoptive parent and the individual that has been adopted, either legally or in fact, as the child of the parent or of an individual who is connected to the parent by blood (except a brother or sister). For the purposes of the GST/HST new housing rebate only, a relation can also be a former spouse, or a former common-law partner.
Residential condominium unit, for the GST/HST new housing rebate purposes, means a housing unit that is for use as a place of residence and that is, or is intended to be, a bounded space in a building designated or described as a separate unit on a registered condominium or strata lot plan or description (or similar plan or description registered under provincial law). A residential condominium unit includes any interest in the common areas as well as any interest in land pertaining to ownership of the unit.
For example, an apartment unit or a townhouse would generally be a residential condominium unit for GST/HST new housing rebate purposes if the unit:

is a housing unit that is for use as a place of residence
is registered as a condominium unit under provincial law
is owned under a deeded title separate from any other unit in a condominium building
can be sold separately from the other units in a condominium building

Residential trailer park generally means a trailer park that includes at least two site, where both of the following conditions are met:

at least 90% of the sites are, or are intended to be, supplied under a lease, licence, or similar arrangement, under which continuous possession or use of a site is provided for a period of at least:
one month in the case of mobile homes or other residential units
twelve months in the case of travel trailers or motor homes, or similar vehicles that are not residential units


the sites are serviced and accessible, and would be suitable for use by occupants or a mobile home as a place of residence throughout the year (whether or not the park in fact has mobile homes)

A residential trailer park includes the land and any buildings and other appurtenances to the land that are reasonably necessary for use by the occupants, or for the operation of the park. If a person has two or more trailer parks that are located right beside each other, the conditions apply to all of the sites, and the trailer parks are considered to be one residential trailer park.
Substantial completion – generally means that construction or substantial renovation of a house is at a stage of completion (generally 90% or more) where an individual can reasonably inhabit the premises. Minor repairs, adjustments, or outstanding upgrades are not considered to impair the use and enjoyment of the house as a place of residence.
Substantial renovation (for purposes of the new housing rebates) – Major changes have to be made to meet the definition of a substantial renovation. In a major renovation project, the interior of a building is essentially gutted. Generally, 90% or more of the interior of the existing housing has to be removed or replaced to qualify as a substantial renovation (90% test).
You do not have to remove or replace the foundation, exterior and interior supporting walls, roof, floors, and staircases to meet the 90% test.
Only livable areas count towards a substantial renovation including finished basements and finished attics. Livable areas do not include garages or crawl spaces. Work done to partially complete a basement but not make it a livable basement does not count toward the 90% test.
For more information, see Technical Information Bulletin B‑092, Substantial Renovations and the GST/HST New Housing Rebate.
Trailer park of a person means a piece of land the person owns or leases and that is only composed of:

one or more sites where each site is, or is intended to be, supplied by the person by way of lease, licence, or similar arrangement to the owner, lessee, or person in occupation or possession of a mobile home, or a travel trailer, motor home, or similar vehicle or trailer, situated or to be situated on the site
other land that is reasonably necessary for:
the use and enjoyment of the sites by individuals residing in or occupying mobile homes, or travel trailers, motor homes, or similar vehicles or trailers, situated or to be situated on those sites
the purpose of operating the park





Important terms


Determining if you are a builder for GST/HST purposes
Builder, for the purpose of GST/HST rebates, generally includes a person who is in the business of constructing or substantially renovating houses for sale. The house may be on land owned or leased by that builder. A builder may also include:

a manufacturer or vendor of a new mobile home or floating home
a person who buys an unoccupied new house for resale
a person who acquires an interest in a house while the house is under construction or substantial renovation, and completes or engages another person to complete the construction or substantial renovation
a person who has converted a non-residential property into a house without substantially renovating the property

An individual is not a builder unless they acquired, built, or substantially renovated housing, or hired someone else to build or substantially renovate housing, in the course of a business or an adventure or concern in the nature of trade of the individual. For example, an individual who buys, builds, or substantially renovates a house to use as their primary place of residence is generally not a builder of that house for GST/HST purposes. For more information, see GST/HST Info Sheet GI-005, Sale of a Residence by a Builder Who is an Individual.
A person hired to provide construction services on land that is leased or owned by someone else, and who does not have an interest in that land, is not generally considered to be a builder. For example, a contractor hired by an owner or a lessee of land to build a new house on the land is not considered to be a builder of the house.


Determining what is considered a house for purposes of the new housing rebate
A house, for the purposes of the GST/HST and/or applicable provincial new housing rebate, generally includes a detached or semi-detached single-unit house, a duplex, a condominium unit, a townhouse, a unit in a co-operative housing corporation, a mobile home (including a modular home), and a floating home. It may also include the land around and underneath the house that is reasonably necessary for its use and enjoyment as a place of residence. This is generally up to one half hectare (1.23 acres) and may include nearby buildings such as a detached garage or shed.
A house may also include a bed and breakfast or similar establishment where rooms are rented for short-term accommodation to the public. If more than 50% of the house is occupied by the owner or a relation as a primary place of residence, a GST/HST and/or applicable provincial new housing rebate may be claimed in respect of the entire house. If 50% or less of the house is occupied by the owner or a relation as a primary place of residence, only the part that is the primary place of residence is eligible for rebate purposes.






In very limited circumstances, a recreational unit may be considered a single-unit residential complex, where it is affixed to the land and modified to include the characteristics of a house. For more information, see GST/HST Policy Statement P‑104, Supply of Land for Recreational Units Such as Mini homes, Park Model Trailers, and Travel Trailers.





Primary place of residence
One of the conditions of eligibility for a new housing rebate to be available is that you must buy or build the house for use as your or your relation's primary place of residence.
Your primary place of residence is generally a house that you own, jointly or otherwise, and that you intend to live in on a permanent basis. You may have more than one place of residence, but you are considered to have only one primary place of residence.






If you buy or build a new house in Canada but your primary place of residence remains outside Canada, then your house in Canada would be a secondary place of residence and would not qualify for the new housing rebate.





The following are examples of some of the factors we may consider to determine whether a house is your or your relation's primary place of residence for purposes of the new housing rebate:

whether you consider the house as your main residence
the length of time you inhabit the premises
the designation of that address on personal and public records such as:
mailing address
income tax (for example, forms or returns)
voting
municipal or school taxes
telephone listing



To be eligible for the new housing rebate, your intent to use the house as your or your relation's primary place of residence must be evident at the outset of buying, constructing, or substantially renovating the house.
For GST/HST new housing rebate purposes, a house is not your primary place of residence if, for example, your intention is to use the house as your primary place of residence upon some more distant occasion, such as retirement. Further, a recreational cottage or an investment property is not your primary place of residence for rebate purposes. No new housing rebate is available in these cases.
For more information, see GST/HST Policy Statement P-228, Primary Place of Residence.


Multiple buyers
The GST/HST new housing rebate may be available if two or more individuals purchase a house or a share of the capital stock of a co-operative housing corporation, or if two or more individuals construct or substantially renovate or engage another person to construct or substantially renovate, a house, in respect of:

an agreement to acquire a house, or a share of the capital stock of a co-operative housing corporation (co-op), entered into after April 19, 2021
a house (other than a mobile home or floating home) if the construction or substantial renovation of the residential complex is substantially completed after April 19, 2021
a mobile home or floating home acquired, imported or brought into a participating province after April 19, 2021

where the house or share of capital stock in a co-operative housing corporation is for use as the primary place of residence of any of the individuals, or a relation of any of the individuals.


Rebates for new housing
The GST/HST new housing rebate allows an individual to recover some of the GST or the federal part of the HST paid for a new or substantially renovated house that is for use as the individual's, or their relation's, primary place of residence, when all of the other conditions are met.






The new housing rebate is only available to individuals who meet all of the conditions for claiming the rebate. However, it is not available to an individual if the individual co-owns the housing with another person who is not an individual.
The new housing rebate is not available to a corporation or a partnership.





Owner-built houses
You may be entitled to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for an owner-built house if you:

built, or engaged someone else to build, a house on land that you already owned or leased
substantially renovated, or engaged someone else to substantially renovate, your existing house (at least 90% of the interior of the existing house must be removed or replaced to be a substantial renovation)
renovated, or engaged someone else to renovate, your existing house and built, or engaged someone else to build, a major addition to your house, to the extent that this is viewed as a newly built house (for example, the addition of a full second story to an existing bungalow). Adding a sun porch, sun room, family room, or bedroom by itself is not a major addition
converted a non-residential property into your house
purchased a new or substantially renovated mobile home or a new floating home from a builder of the home (this includes the manufacturer or vendor of the home) or you or someone you hired substantially renovated such a home

For a mobile or a floating home, you can claim either the owner-built new housing rebate or the new housing rebate for a house purchased from a builder, mentioned below.






If you renovated your house or built an addition to your existing house, see Substantial renovation, major addition, and conversion to determine if the work you have done is extensive enough to consider your house as new.





For more information, see New housing rebate for owner-built houses.


Houses purchased from a builder
You may be entitled to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for a house purchased from a builder if one of the following apply:

you purchased a new or substantially renovated house (building and land) from a builder
you purchased a new or substantially renovated mobile home or a new floating home from a builder (this includes the manufacturer or vendor)
you purchased a share of the capital stock of a co-operative housing corporation (co-op) where the co-op has paid tax in respect of a new or substantially renovated house
you purchased a new or substantially renovated house from a builder where you leased the land from that builder under the same agreement to buy the house and the lease is for 20 years or more or gives you the option to buy the land

For more information, see New housing rebate for houses purchased from a builder.


Provincial new housing rebates
One of the following provincial new housing rebates may be available for the provincial part of the HST whether the GST/HST new housing rebate for the federal part of the HST is available or not.


Nova Scotia rebate
If your house is located in Nova Scotia, you may qualify for a rebate for some of the provincial part of the HST that you paid to buy or build the new house (a Nova Scotia rebate is not available for the substantial renovation of a house). For more information, see Nova Scotia new housing rebate for owner-built houses or Nova Scotia new housing rebate for houses purchased from a builder.


Ontario rebate
If you paid the HST to buy, build, or substantially renovate a house located in Ontario you may be entitled to claim a provincial new housing rebate for some of the provincial part of the HST that you paid. For more information, see Ontario new housing rebate for owner-built houses or Ontario new housing rebate for houses purchased from a builder.


Other new housing rebate


GST/HST new residential rental property rebate If you buy, build, or substantially renovate housing to rent for long-term residential use by individuals as their primary place of residence, you are not entitled to claim the GST/HST new housing rebate. However, you may be entitled to claim the GST/HST new residential rental property rebate. For more information, see Guide RC4231, GST/HST New Residential Rental Property Rebate.


New housing rebates for owner-built houses


GST/HST new housing rebate for owner-built houses
For an owner-built house, as previously described, you can claim the GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the GST and/or the federal part of the HST that you paid to build the house if you meet all of the following conditions:

you built, or engaged someone else to build or substantially renovate the house (and in the case of a mobile home, floating home or modular home that is not a mobile home, purchased the home), as described in this guide, for use as your or your relation's primary place of residence (for more information, see Primary place of residence)
the fair market value of the house at the time that the work is substantially completed is less than $450,000 (the fair market value of the land, building and any other structures must be included in determining this value)
you or your relation is the first individual to occupy the house since the construction or substantial renovation began or you made an exempt sale of the house and transferred ownership before it was occupied by anyone (for information on when your sale of a house may be exempt, see Selling the house before anyone occupied it)
you paid the GST/HST on the purchase of the land, or an interest in the land, on which the house is situated and/or on the construction materials and services related to the construction or substantial renovation, or on the purchase of the mobile home or floating home







If you are entitled to claim a new housing rebate for your purchase of a mobile or floating home, you have the option to claim either the new housing rebate for owner-built houses or the new housing rebate for purchasers of new housing from a builder. For a modular home, this option is only available if the modular home is considered to be a mobile home. For more information about your options, see Modular home, mobile home, and floating home.





If two or more individuals construct or substantially renovate, or engage another person to construct or substantially renovate, a house, a new housing rebate may be available where the house is for use as the primary place of residence of any of the individuals, or a relation of any of the individuals, provided that all the other conditions for the rebate are met by at least one of the individuals. However, only one of the individuals may apply for the rebate (that is, only one can be the claimant).
The conditions above, except for the $450,000 maximum, also apply for the Ontario new housing rebate.


Selling the house before anyone occupied it
If you made an exempt sale of the house and transferred the ownership to the purchaser before you, or anyone else, occupied it, you may be eligible to claim a new housing rebate if you had originally intended that the house would be the primary place of residence for you or a relation and all of the other conditions for the house rebate, discussed above, are met.
Generally, your sale of a house will be exempt if you are not considered to be a builder of the house for GST/HST purposes and you did not claim any input tax credits for the GST/HST payable on costs incurred to build or substantially renovate the house.
You may be the builder of the house for GST/HST purposes if you had a primary or secondary intention to sell the house instead of using it as your or your relation's primary place of residence. If you are a builder of the house, your sale of the house may be taxable and no new housing rebate would be available to you. For more information, see Info Sheet GI-005, Sale of a Residence by a Builder Who is an Individual, and Guide RC4052, GST/HST Information for the Home Construction Industry.


Nova Scotia new housing rebate for owner-built houses
The Nova Scotia First Time Home Buyers rebate may be available to you if the owner-built house is located in Nova Scotia. If so, you have to claim the Nova Scotia rebate with the Province of Nova Scotia. For more information on this rebate, contact Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations.


Ontario new housing rebate for owner-built houses
An Ontario new housing rebate may be available even if the fair market value of the house is $450,000 or more.
You are eligible to claim an Ontario new housing rebate if you are an individual who paid the HST to build or substantially renovate a house, build a major addition that forms part of a renovation of your house, or convert a non-residential building to residential use, that house is located in Ontario and is for use as your, or your relation’s, primary place of residence, and either:

you are eligible to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the federal part of the HST
the only reason you are not eligible to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the federal part of the HST is that the fair market value of the house is $450,000 or more

The maximum Ontario new housing rebate amount for owner-built houses depends on whether you paid the HST on your purchase of the land. The rebate is limited to a maximum of $24,000 if you paid the HST on the purchase of the land, and $16,080 if you did not.


Substantial renovation, major addition, and conversion
You may be entitled to claim the GST/HST new housing rebate if you:

substantially renovated your existing house
converted a non-residential property into a house
built a major addition onto your existing house if, along with that addition, you also substancially renovated the existing house







You may also be entitled to claim an Ontario new housing rebate if the house is located in Ontario.





The following information will help you determine if the construction work you did to your house is extensive enough to qualify for the new housing rebate. You also have to meet all of the other eligibility conditions to be entitled to the new housing rebate. See Owner-built houses for all of these conditions.


Substantial renovation
If a house has been substantially renovated, it is generally treated as a newly built house.
Only certain major changes will meet the definition of a substantial renovation. For a substantial renovation, the interior of a house is essentially gutted. Generally, 90% or more of the interior of an existing house is the minimum that has to be removed or replaced to qualify as a substantial renovation (90% test).
You do not have to remove or replace the foundation, exterior and interior supporting walls, roof, floors, and staircases to meet the 90% test. If you do remove or replace any of these during a substantial renovation, the GST/HST paid for doing this or for the removal or replacement is also eligible for the rebate.
Any fair and reasonable method can be used to determine if you meet the 90% test. For example, comparing the square metres of the renovated livable floor space to the total square metres of livable floor space of the house is an acceptable measure of the 90% test. You can also compare the square metres of the floor and wall space of the areas renovated to the total floor and wall space of the house.
Only livable areas count toward a substantial renovation. This would include the main floor living areas and finished basements and attics. Livable areas do not include garages or crawl spaces, which are not considered when meeting the 90% test. Work done to partially complete a basement but not make it a livable basement does not count toward the 90% test. However, if all or part of an unfinished basement was renovated into a livable area, this area would be taken into account in applying the 90% test.
A renovation of your basement, or adding a garage or a deck to your existing house, by itself, would not meet the definition of a substantial renovation and you would not qualify for the new housing rebate.
An addition to a house is not in itself considered to be a substantial renovation, as it is the existing house that must be substantially renovated. For example, if a 700 square foot bungalow is being renovated and a 100 square foot addition is added, the 90% test does not consider the addition. However, if the renovation of the 700 square foot bungalow is found to be a substantial renovation, the GST/HST paid on the addition is also eligible for the GST/HST new housing rebate.


Major addition
You may qualify for the GST/HST new housing rebate when you build, or engage someone else to build, an addition to your house, along with the substantial renovation of the existing house. The work must be so great that the result is viewed as a newly built house.
The construction of a porch, sunroom, family room, or bedroom by itself is not considered to be a major addition.


Conversion
When you convert a property from non-residential use into your house, it is considered a substantial renovation, even if the extent of the work, if any, does not meet the requirements for substantial renovation (as described in Substantial renovation). You then qualify for the GST/HST new housing rebate if you meet all of the other conditions for claiming the rebate.
If you buy a building that was used by a person for non-residential purposes and the building is for use as your, or your relation's, primary place of residence, the GST/HST new housing rebate is available for a part of any GST/HST paid on the purchase and other improvements made to convert the building if you meet all of the other conditions for claiming the rebate.
If you held or used the building as capital property in your business, and you begin to use the building as your residence, you are considered to have sold and repurchased the property and have to pay the GST/HST to the CRA, calculated on the fair market value of the property. If you meet all of the conditions for the GST/HST new housing rebate, you can include the GST/HST that you paid to the CRA, plus the GST/HST you paid in improvements, in your rebate calculation.
If you paid the GST/HST when you first bought the building to hold or use as capital property in your business and you were not entitled to claim an input tax credit (ITC) for all or part of the GST/HST you paid on the purchase or on any improvements you made to the building before you began to use it as your residence, you may be entitled to claim an ITC or a rebate. For more information, call 1-800-959-8287.
For more information on substantial renovation, major additions, and conversion, see Technical Information Bulletin B-092, Substantial Renovations and the GST/HST New Housing Rebate.


Forms you have to fill out for an owner-built house
Form GST191-WS, Construction Summary Worksheet. You have to fill out this form first. It will help you determine the amount of the GST/HST you paid during the construction and it will help determine if you qualify for the rebate. You must fill out this form even if you are only claiming the Ontario new housing rebate.
Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses. You have to fill out this form to claim your owner-built home rebate. If you are entitled to claim a new housing rebate for some of the GST or federal part of the HST you paid, you will calculate your rebate amount on this form. If you are only eligible to claim an Ontario new housing rebate, you still have to fill out all of Form GST191, except for Part D.
If the house is located in Ontario, in addition to filling out Form GST191-WS and Form GST191, you can use Form RC7191-ON, GST191 Ontario Rebate Schedule, to calculate your Ontario new housing rebate.
If the rebate is for a property in Ontario, once you have filled out Form GST191 WS, Form GST191, and if you are entitled to claim the Ontario new housing rebate, Form RC7191 ON as well, send these forms together to:
Sudbury Tax Centre
 1050 Notre Dame Avenue
 Sudbury ON P3A 5C1
If the rebate is for a property located anywhere else in Canada, once you have filled out Form GST191 WS and Form GST191, send these forms together to:
Prince Edward Island Tax Centre
 275 Pope Road
 Summerside PE  C1N 6A2


Sending your rebate claim online
To send your new housing rebate claim for an owner-built house online using My Account, fill out and upload Form GST191-WS, Construction Summary Worksheet, to My Account before filling out the information from Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses. To claim the Ontario new housing rebate for owner built houses, you also have to fill out Form RC7191-ON, GST191 Ontario Rebate Schedule, online. For more information, go to My Account.


Documents you have to send us
In most cases, you do not have to send supporting documentation with your application. However, you do have to send invoices with your worksheet where the vendor did not charge GST/HST on the invoice (photocopies of these invoices will be accepted). You also may be contacted and requested to submit proof of occupancy.


Documents you have to keep
Keep a copy of the completed forms. You also have to keep all your original invoices and the other documents you used to fill out the forms for six years in case we ask to see them.
Only original invoices in the name of the claimant or the co-owners are acceptable. We do not accept photocopies, credit card or Interac slips, or account statements, without the original invoices. We do not accept estimates or quotes as proof. If we ask you to send your invoices to the CRA, we will return them.


When will you receive your payment?
Because all claims are subject to audit, you may experience a delay of up to six months before receiving your payment. The processing of your claim may be delayed or your rebate denied if the forms are not completed in full, the rebate calculation is incorrect, or if the required documents are not submitted with your application.


Filing deadlines: what is your base date
The following three situations will help you determine which filing deadline applies to you if you are filing a rebate for an owner-built house. The filing deadline for the Ontario new housing rebate is the same as the filing deadline for the GST/HST new housing rebate.


Situation 1 – House occupied after the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed
If you or your relation is the first to occupy the house after the construction or substantial renovation is substantially complete, you can apply for the rebate after the house is occupied.
Enter your base date for your filing deadline in Part B of Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses. In this situation, your base date is the date the construction or the substantial renovation is substantially completed.
You have up to two years after your base date to claim the rebate. You can include the GST/HST you paid for the construction of the house and the purchase of the land, or interest in the land, on which you built the house, if any, as long as you paid that tax by the date you file your rebate application.






Hassan started building his house in September 2020. The house is substantially completed on April 30, 2021, and he moves in on May 31, 2021. According to the rule in Situation 1, the earliest that he can apply for the rebate is May 31, 2021 (the day he first occupied the house). However, his base date used to determine his filing deadline is April 30, 2021 (the day construction was substantially completed). Hassan enters April 30, 2021, in Part B of Form GST191. This means that he has until April 30, 2023, to claim the rebate for a part of the GST/HST he paid to build his house, as long as the tax he includes in his claim was paid before the date he files his rebate application.





Situation 2 – Exempt sale of the house before it is occupied
If you made an exempt sale of the house and transferred ownership to the purchaser before it was occupied by anyone, you can apply for the rebate after the house is sold.
Enter your base date for your filing deadline in Part B of Form GST191. In this situation, your base date is the earlier of the following two dates:

the date you transfer ownership to the purchaser
the date the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed

You have up to two years after your base date to claim the rebate. You can include the GST/HST you paid for the construction of the house and the purchase of the land, or interest in the land, on which you built the house, if any, as long as you paid that tax by the date you file your rebate application.


Situation 3 – House occupied before construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed
If you or your relation is the first to occupy the house and this occurs before the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed, you can apply for the rebate after the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed.
Enter your base date for your filing deadline in Part B of Form GST191. In this situation, your base date is the earlier of the following two dates:

the day that is two years after the day you or a relation first occupied the house after the construction or substantial renovation has begun
the date the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed

You have up to two years after your base date to claim the rebate. You can include the GST/HST you paid for the construction of the house and the purchase of the land on which you built the house, if any, as long as you paid that tax by the date you file your rebate application.
However, do not include in your rebate calculation any GST/HST that became payable more than two years after the day you or a relation first occupied the house after the construction or substantial renovation began.






France and Tony started building their house in March 2020. They moved in on June 30, 2021. Construction was substantially completed on November 20, 2021. The earliest date to file the rebate application is November 20, 2021.
France or Tony enter November 20, 2021, in Part B of Form GST191, as the base date, which is the earliest of the following dates:

June 30, 2023, which is the date that is two years after the day they first occupied the house
November 20, 2021, which is the date the construction is substantially completed

This means that France or Tony have until November 20, 2023, to claim the rebate. However, any GST/HST that became payable after June 30, 2023, cannot be included in the rebate calculation.





Late-filed rebate applications
If, due to extraordinary circumstances, you were prevented from filing your rebate application for an owner-built home by the applicable deadline, we will consider a request to accept your late-filed rebate application. Such extraordinary circumstances may include: natural or human made disasters, such as a flood or fire; civil disturbances or disruptions in services, such as a postal strike; serious illness or accident; or serious emotional or mental distress. We will also consider a request to accept a late-filed owner- built home rebate application where the delay resulted primarily from our actions, for example if we provided you with inaccurate information.






This applies only for owner built homes. It does not apply if you purchased a house from a builder.





How to fill out Form GST191-WS
You have to fill out and submit Form GST191-WS, Construction Summary Worksheet with your rebate application. Fill out this form before you fill out Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses or a provincial rebate schedule (if applicable).
As all claims are subject to audit, make sure this worksheet is completed in full to avoid a delay in processing your claim or having it denied.


Part A – Claimant information
You have to fill out this part.

How to fill out Form GST191
You have to file Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses to claim the new housing rebate.
You can only apply for the new housing rebate once for each house using a single application form. You cannot file another rebate application for additional work, or extras done on your house.
Only one individual can apply for the rebate, even if there is more than one owner of a house. For example, if a couple build a new house, only one name of one spouse can appear as the claimant on the application form. The name of the other spouse should appear as the co-owner. The rebate amount will be paid to the claimant only.
You have to fill out all parts of Form GST191, unless the fair market value (FMV) of your house is $450,000 or more and you are only filling out this form to claim the Ontario new housing rebate. In this case, fill out all parts except for Part D.
Be sure that each least one of the individuals who constructed or substantially renovated the house, or engaged another person to do so, meets all of the eligibility conditions for claiming the rebate. If you are paid a rebate amount to which you are not entitled, you are required to repay it to the CRA.


Part A – Claimant information
You have to fill out this part. Only one individual can claim the rebate, even if more than one individual owns the house.
If several individuals own the house, enter one name as the claimant on the first line, and then the name(s) of the other co-owner(s) on the second line. The rebate cheque will be issued in the name of the claimant only.






Lisa and David built a new house. In the box "Claimant's legal name", Lisa enters her legal name. David's name appears on the second line as the co-owner. The rebate cheque will be issued in the name of Lisa.





Part B – House information
You have to fill out this part.
Indicate whether you built or substantially renovated the house for use as your or your relation's primary place of residence. For more information, see Primary place of residence.
The base date for your filing deadline that you have to enter will depend on your situation. To determine your base date, see situation 1, 2, or 3, under Filing deadlines: what is your base date.


Part C – Type of construction and housing
Tick the boxes that apply to your type of construction and type of housing.


Part D – Rebate calculation
If the FMV of the house, including the land, is $450,000 or more, do not fill out Part D since you are not eligible to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the GST, or federal part of the HST.
However, if the house is located in Ontario, you may claim the Ontario new housing rebate for some of the provincial part of the HST you paid to build or substantially renovate your house. If you are eligible to claim the Ontario new housing rebate, fill out Form RC7191-ON, GST191 Ontario Rebate Schedule, and attach it to Form GST191 and Form GST191-WS.

Enter on line A the amount from line A in Part D of Form GST191-WS. This is the total amount of the GST you paid at the rate of 5%.
Line B
Enter on line B the amount from line B in Part D of Form GST191-WS. This is the total amount of the GST you paid at the rate of 6%.

Line H
Multiply line G by 36% and enter the result on line H.
Go directly to line P if one of the following situations applies to you:

almost all of the GST/HST you paid on your purchases was at the rate of 5%, 12%, or 13%
almost all of the GST/HST you paid on your purchases was at the rate of 6% or 14%
almost all of the GST/HST you paid on your purchases was at the rate of 7% or 15%

Almost all means 90% or more.
If one of the above situations does not apply to you, this means that you paid the GST and/or the HST at different rates. This would be the case if, for example, you paid 7% GST on the land and 5% GST on the construction materials. If this is your situation, complete the calculations on lines I through O.
Line I
Add lines B and E and enter the result on line I.
Line J
Divide line I by line G and enter the result on line J. This result is not a dollar amount. It is a fraction that should start with "0" followed by a decimal point if you paid the GST/HST at different rates. It would equal 1 if you paid the GST/HST at one rate. Enter only the first four digits following the decimal point.
Line K
Multiply the fraction you have on line J by $1,260 and enter the result on line K.
Line L
Add lines C and F and enter the result on line L.
Line M
Divide line L by line G and enter the result on line M. This result is not a dollar amount. It is a fraction that should start with "0" followed by a decimal point if you paid the GST/HST at different rates. It would equal 1 if you paid the GST/HST at one rate. Enter only the first four digits following the decimal point.
Line N
Multiply the fraction you have on line M by $2,520 and enter the result on line N.
Line O
Add lines K and N. Then add $6,300 to that result. Enter the result on line O.

Situation 2: If 90% or more of the GST/HST you paid on your purchases was at the rate of 6% or 14% (where the federal part of the HST was 6%), enter $7,560 on line P.
Situation 3: If 90% or more of the GST/HST you paid on your purchases was at the rate of 7% or 15% (where the federal part of the HST was 7%), enter $8,750 on line P.
Situation 4: In any other case, enter on line P the lesser of $8,750 or the amount from line O.

Enter on line R the FMV of the house (building, land, and other buildings such as a detached garage or shed, that are reasonably necessary for the use and enjoyment of the house as a place of residence) at the time the construction or substantial renovation was substantially completed. This amount should be the same as the amount you entered in Part B of Form GST191-WS.
You may want to get a professional appraisal to support your rebate claim if the FMV of your house is close to, or more than, $350,000. Include the house and land but do not include provincial land transfer taxes in determining the FMV. We may ask for information to support your appraisal.
Line S
If the amount on line R is $350,000 or less, enter the amount from line Q.
If the amount on line R is $450,000 or more, enter "0", since no GST/HST new housing rebate is available. You may still be eligible to claim a provincial new housing rebate if the house is located in a province that offers such a rebate. For more information, see Nova Scotia new housing rebate for owner-built houses or Ontario new housing rebates for owner-built houses.
If the amount on line R is more than $350,000, but less than $450,000, do the calculation and enter the result on line S. Your rebate is reduced when the FMV is between $350,001 and $449,999.
The amount calculated for line S is the amount of your GST/HST new housing rebate.
Line T
You may also be eligible to claim the Ontario new housing rebate if the house is located in Ontario. If you are eligible, complete the calculation on Form RC7191-ON, GST191 Ontario Rebate Schedule and enter the result on line T. Send Form RC7191-ON to the CRA along with your completed Form GST191.

However, you still have to fill out parts A, B, C, and E of Form GST191.


New housing rebates for houses purchased from a builder
You may be eligible to claim the GST/HST new housing rebate if you:

purchased a new or substantially renovated house (building and land) from a builder
purchased a new or substantially renovated mobile or floating home from a builder (this includes the manufacturer or vendor)
purchased a share of the capital stock of a co-operative housing corporation (co-op)
purchased a new or substantially renovated house from a builder where you leased the land from that builder under the same agreement to buy the house and the lease is for 20 years or more or gives you the option to buy the land







Where a purchase and sale agreement for a new house is assigned to you, there may be two builders of the house – the original builder (Builder A) and the first purchaser (the assignor). If that is the case, you would generally have to pay the GST/HST to Builder A for the purchase of the new house and to the first purchaser for the purchase of the interest in the new house. For more information, see Info Sheet GI-120, Assignment of a Purchase and Sale Agreement for a New House or Condominium Unit.





For more information on what type of housing qualifies for this rebate, see Determined what is considered a house for purposes of the new housing rebate
The following information will help you determine if you are eligible to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate and fill out the necessary forms.






If two or more individuals purchase a house or a share of the capital stock of a co-op, a new housing rebate may be available where the house or the share of the capital stock of a co op is for use as the primary place of residence of any of the individuals, or a relation of any of the individuals, provided that all the other eligibility conditions for the rebate are met by at least one of the individuals. Only one of the individuals may apply for the rebate (that is, only one may be the claimant). The eligibility conditions for each of the rebate application types are discussed in the following sections.





Nova Scotia new housing rebate for houses purchased from a builder
The Nova Scotia First-Time Home Buyers Rebate may be available to you if the house you purchased is located in Nova Scotia.






If so, you have to claim the Nova Scotia rebate with the Province of Nova Scotia. For more information on this rebate, contact Service Nova Scotia and Municipal Relations.





Ontario new housing rebate for houses purchased from a builder
An Ontario new housing rebate may be available even if the total price or fair market value of the house is above the applicable threshold.
You are eligible to claim the Ontario new housing rebate if you bought a new or substantially renovated house (including a new condominium unit, mobile home or floating home) from a builder or you bought a share of capital stock of a co-op, the house is located in Ontario and is for use as your or your relation's primary place of residence, and either:

you are eligible to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the federal part of the HST
the only reason you are not eligible to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the federal part of the HST is because the total price or fair market value of the house exceeds the applicable threshold

The maximum Ontario new housing rebate amount that is available is $24,000.


Forms you have to fill out for a house purchased from a builder
Form RC7190-WS, GST190 Calculation Worksheet. Use this form to calculate the amount of your GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the GST, or federal part of the HST, you paid. You will report the amount of your rebate on Form GST190. You do not need to file Form RC7190-WS with us; keep it with your records as your rebate claim is subject to audit. If you are only claiming the Ontario new housing rebate, you do not need to fill out Form RC7190-WS.
Form GST190, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Houses Purchased from a Builder. You have to fill out this form to claim your new housing rebate. You must fill out this form even if you are only claiming the Ontario new housing rebate. If you are claiming a GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the GST or federal part of the HST, you will also need to fill out Form RC7190-WS to calculate the amount of your rebate.
If your house is located in Ontario, in addition to filling out Form GST190 and Form RC7190-WS (if applicable), use Form RC7190-ON, GST190 Ontario Rebate Schedule to calculate your Ontario new housing rebate.


If the builder pays or credits the amount of the GST/HST new housing rebate to you
When you buy a house from a builder, the builder may pay the total amount of your new housing rebate, including the Ontario new housing rebate that you are entitled to claim, directly to you or credit the amount against the total amount payable for the house so that you do not have to apply to the CRA directly and wait to receive your rebate.






Only the builder who sells you the house is authorized to pay or credit a GST/HST new housing rebate or the Ontario new housing rebate to you. If you previously paid tax to a person (assignor) who assigned the agreement of purchase and sale to you (because they, too, were a builder for GST/HST purposes), the assignor cannot pay or credit an amount to you.





If you and the builder agree that the builder will pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate, and the builder does so, you have to fill out and sign Form GST190, Form RC7190-ON (if applicable) and the worksheet. The builder has to send us your rebate application and the Ontario rebate schedule (if applicable). You do not send us any of these forms. You may not file any other new housing rebate application directly with us for this house (for example, for tax paid to the assignor on the purchase of the interest in the house). If you have paid tax to both a builder and an assignor, you may want to file a rebate using application Type 2. See Application Type 1A or 2: You bought the house and land from the same builder.
Send these documents to:
Prince Edward Island Tax Centre
 275 Pope Road
 Summerside PE  C1N 6A2 






Builders filing a Type 1A or Type 1B rebate application can file their rebate application electronically. Builders that must file their GST/HST returns electronically can submit their Type 1A or Type 1B rebate application electronically together with their GST/HST return for the reporting period in which the amount of the rebate was paid or credited to the buyer.
To file the application electronically, you can use GST/HST NETFILE or you can use the “File a return” or “File a rebate” online services in:

My Business Account, if you are a business owner
Represent a Client, if you are an authorized representative or employee

All other builders that must file their GST/HST returns electronically must send us the rebate application by mail immediately after they file their GST/HST return for the reporting period in which the amount of the rebate was paid or credited to the buyer. Builders with taxable revenues of more than $1,500,000 must use GST/HST NETFILE or GST/HST TELEFILE to file their returns for these reporting periods where they have paid or credited the amount of the rebate to the buyer. Builders may also be required to electronically file their GST/HST returns for other reasons. For more information, see Guide RC4022, General Information for GST/HST Registrants, Info Sheet GI-099, Builders and Electronic Filing Requirements, or Info Sheet GI-118, Builders and GST/HST NETFILE.
Builders should not confuse this filing deadline for the rebate application with the deadline for claiming ITCs or the two-year deadline for buyers to claim the rebate.





A builder who pays or credits you with the amount of the rebate has to make sure that you meet all of the eligibility conditions for the rebate, listed in the following sections, before they pay or credit you with the amount. For example, at the time of purchase, the house must be intended to be the primary place of residence for you or your relation. In addition, the total price you paid for the house before tax must be less than $450,000. The "total price" includes, if applicable, the price you paid to an assignor to have the purchase and sale agreement assigned to you if the assignment was subject to the GST/HST. This is the case whether or not the assignor is registered for the GST/HST.

The filing deadlines are also explained within the sections for each rebate type.


Documents you have to keep
Keep a copy of the completed rebate application form, including the Ontario rebate schedule (if applicable) and the calculation worksheet. You  do not have to submit proof of occupancy with your application. However, we may ask you to provide proof of occupancy later.

Which rebate application type to use
There are five rebate application types in Part C of Form GST190. Each type has its own eligibility requirements and filing deadline. The eligibility requirements and filing deadlines are the same if you are claiming the Ontario new housing rebate, except for the maximum purchase price or fair market value.






If you bought a modular home, a mobile home, or a floating home, see Modular home, mobile home, and floating home for more information on which application type to use. You cannot use Form GST190, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Houses Purchased from a Builder to claim a rebate for a modular home that is not considered to be a mobile home.





Fill out your rebate application using one of the following application types, as follows:

Use Application Type 1A if you buy both the house and the related land from the same builder under the same written agreement, and the builder pays the amount of the rebate directly to you or credits the amount against the total amount payable for the house. In this case, the builder has to send us the completed rebate application. You may not file a rebate application directly with us for this house.
Use Application Type 1B if you buy the house and lease the related land from the same builder under the same written agreement, and the builder pays the amount of the rebate directly to you or credits the amount against the total amount payable for the house. In this case, the builder has to send us the completed rebate application. You may not file a rebate application directly with us for this house.
Use Application Type 2 if you buy the house and the related land from the same builder under the same written agreement and the builder does not pay the amount of the rebate directly to you and does not credit the amount against the total amount payable for the house. In this case, you have to file the rebate application directly with us.
Use Application Type 3 if you buy a share of the capital stock of a co-op. In this case, you have to file the rebate application directly with us.
Use Application Type 5 if you buy the house and lease the related land from the same builder under the same written agreement, and the builder does not pay the amount of the rebate directly to you and does not credit the amount against the total amount payable for the house. In this case, you have to file the rebate application directly with us.



Application Type 1A or 2: You bought the house and land from the same builder
As an individual, you are eligible to claim the GST/HST new housing rebate if you meet all of the following conditions:

you bought a new or substantially renovated house (this includes a condominium unit, a renovated house that has also had a major addition or a non residential property that was converted into a house) from a builder, and you paid all of the GST/HST due on your purchase
the builder sells you the house and the related land on which the house is located under the same written agreement. If it is a mobile home or a floating home, you may be able to use Application Type 1A or 2 even if the vendor does not sell you the land. See Modular home, mobile home, and floating home to see if you can use Type 1A or 2 and then make sure that you meet all of the eligibility conditions listed here
when you sign the purchase and sale agreement, the house is intended to be the primary place of residence for you or your relation
the purchase price for the house (including the land, where applicable), plus the purchase price for a taxable assignment to you of the original purchase and sale agreement (if applicable), before tax, is less than $450,000 (see the Notes below)
ownership of the house is transferred to you after the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed
after the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed, no one occupied the house before possession of the house is given to you
one of the following applies to you:
you, or a relation of yours, are the first occupant of the house as a place or residence
you made an exempt sale of the house before it is occupied by anyone. For more information, see Selling the house before anyone occupied it









If the total purchase price (including the amount paid for a taxable assignment of a purchase and sale agreement, if applicable) is $450,000 or more, you are not eligible to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the GST or federal part of the HST. However, if your house is located in Ontario, you may still be eligible to claim the Ontario new housing rebate for some of the provincial part of the HST you paid to buy the house.
If you are filing an application Type 1A, your claim is based on the GST/HST paid on the house, land, and related services bought from the builder under one written agreement. If you also paid tax to a previous purchaser to buy their interest in the house (by way of an assignment of the purchase and sale agreement), you may want to file the rebate using application Type 2 in order to claim both the tax paid to the builder and to the person who assigned you the agreement.





Use Application Type 1A if you and the builder agree that the builder will pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate and the builder does so. In this case, do not file a rebate application directly with us for this house. Use Application Type 2 if the builder does not pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate. In this case, you file your rebate application directly with us. If you hired a contractor to build a house on land you own or lease, see Owner-built houses. The contractor cannot pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate if it is an owner built house. If you bought a mobile home or a floating home from a builder and other items that you did not buy from the builder (for example, land or improvements to the mobile home or floating home), see Modular home, mobile home, and floating home for more information on which application type to use.


Filing deadline for Application Type 1A or 2
If the builder does not pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate, you have to file your rebate claim directly with us. In this case you have up to two years from the date ownership was transferred to you to claim your rebate.
Generally, if the builder pays or credits you with the amount of the rebate, you will either sign the application form in the presence of the builder or you can sign the application form in the presence of your lawyer who will send the signed application form to the builder. This is usually done around the time of the closing date for your purchase.
If this does not happen, you have up to two years after the day ownership of the house is transferred to you to get the application form to the builder and have the builder pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate. In any case, if the builder paid or credited the amount of the rebate to you, the builder has to send the rebate application form to the CRA.
For GST/HST purposes, ownership generally means the legal ownership (that is, titled ownership) to the property that is transferred to you on the closing of the sale.

you bought a new or substantially renovated house (this includes a condominium unit, a renovated house that has also had a major addition, a non-residential property that was converted into a house, or a mobile home on land that is not a site in a residential trailer park) from a builder and you lease the related land from that builder (or the builder assigns you the lease of the related land) under the same written agreement to buy the house
the lease for the land with the builder gives you the option to buy the land, or is at least 20 years long
when you sign the agreement to purchase the house and lease the land, the house is intended to be the primary place of residence for you or a relation
the builder was required to pay the GST/HST on the fair market value of the house (building and the land)
the fair market value of the house (building and land) was less than the applicable maximum when possession was transferred to you (see Maximum fair market value to find out the maximum that applies to you)
possession of the house is given to you after the construction or substantial renovation is substantially completed

one of the following applies to you:
you, or a relation of yours, are the first occupant of the house
you made an exempt sale of the house and transfer possession to the buyer before it is occupied by anyone









If the fair market value of the house including the land exceeds the applicable maximum, you are not entitled to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate. However, if your house is located in Ontario, you may still be eligible to claim the Ontario new housing rebate.





Use Application Type 1B, if you and the builder agree that the builder will pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate and the builder does so.

In this case, you file your rebate application with us.


Maximum fair market value
You are not entitled to claim a GST/HST new housing rebate for some of the GST or federal part of the HST if the fair market value of your house (building and land) exceeds the applicable maximum. The maximum fair market value is:

$472,500 if the builder had to account for the GST at 5% on the self-supply of the house
$508,500 if the house is located in Ontario and the builder had to account for the HST at 13%
$517,500 if the house is located in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, or Prince Edward Island, and the builder had to account for the HST at 15% on the self-supply of the house







The maximum fair market value may differ if another rate applied when the builder had to account for tax on the self supply. To find out the rate at which the builder had to account for tax on the self-supply, see Part D of Form GST190 or contact your builder.

For example, if a couple buys a new house, only the name of one spouse can appear as the claimant on the application form. The name of the other spouse should appear as the co-owner. The rebate amount will be paid to the claimant only.

Reference in this guide to a mobile home includes a modular home if that modular meets the criteria to be considered a mobile home.
A builder includes the manufacturer, distributor, or retailer of your mobile or floating home, and is commonly referred to as a dealer. A mobile home generally includes qualifying land. Qualifying land is the land on which the mobile home sits and the surrounding land (unless the home is situated in a residential trailer park) that is reasonably necessary for its use and enjoyment as a place of residence (generally up to one-half hectare).
If you bought a new or a substantially renovated mobile or floating home, you can choose one of three different options for claiming the GST/HST new housing rebate. In the case of a modular home, these options are not available if your modular home is not considered to be a mobile home.
You have to determine which option is the best for you (you can only fill out one rebate application):

Option 1 – You claim the rebate only on items the dealer sold you and the dealer pays or credits you with the amount of the rebate.
Option 2 – You claim the rebate only on items the dealer sold you and the dealer does not pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate.
Option 3 – You claim the rebate on the purchase of your mobile home or floating home from the dealer, as well as other items that you bought from the dealer under a separate agreement or that you did not buy from the dealer but do form part of the house (for example, the land, or improvements to the mobile or floating home or land).

If two or more individuals buy a mobile home or a floating home, a new housing rebate may be available where the mobile home or floating home is for use as the primary place of residence of any of the individuals, or a relation of any of the individuals, provided that all the other eligibility conditions, discussed in the following sections, for the rebate are met by a least one of the individuals. However, only one of the individuals can apply for the rebate (that is, only one can be the claimant).


Option 1
If the builder (the dealer) pays or credits you with the amount of the rebate, fill out Form GST190, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Houses Purchased from a Builder, Form RC7190-WS, GST190 Calculation Worksheet, and, if you are eligible for the Ontario new housing rebate, Form RC7190-ON, GST190 Ontario Rebate Schedule. In this case, you may be able to use either Application Type 1A or 1B.


Application Type 1A
Where the builder is paying or crediting you with the amount of the rebate, use Application Type 1A if:

you bought a floating home from a builder
you bought a mobile home from a builder, and you are claiming a rebate for:
only the mobile home, and you are not claiming a rebate for any qualifying land or improvements. For example, you may not have paid tax on your purchase of the land. In this case, no rebate would be available for the land
the mobile home and the related land that you also bought from the builder under the same written agreement for the purchase of the mobile home. If you are claiming a rebate for the mobile home and also for qualifying land that you bought under a separate agreement from the mobile home, see Option 3 for more information
the mobile home where you are leasing a site in a residential trailer park from the dealer. See the definition of a residential trailer park. If you are leasing land from the dealer but it is not in a residential trailer park, do not use Application Type 1A. Use Type 1B instead





Application Type 1B
Where the builder is paying or crediting you with the amount of the rebate, use Application Type 1B if:

you bought a mobile home
you are leasing the qualifying land from the builder under the same written agreement to buy the mobile home
the land is not a site in a residential trailer park
the lease of the land is for 20 years or more, or gives you the option to buy the land

If the land is a site in a residential trailer park, do not use Application Type 1B. Use Type 1A instead.
In the case of a floating home, use Application Type 1A.
If you choose Option 1, you can claim a rebate only on items that the dealer sold you. If the dealer also sells you qualifying land under the same written agreement for the purchase of your home, the dealer can pay or credit you with the amount of the rebate for the GST/HST you paid on the land, as well as on the expenses you have paid to the dealer to improve the land (such as building a foundation, adding a driveway, well or septic system, or landscaping).
Option 1 is not to your advantage if you paid the GST/HST to someone other than the dealer for the land or any improvements made to the land, or if you paid the GST/HST on other qualifying items not purchased from the dealer. In this case, see Option 3.


Option 2
Where the builder (the dealer) is not paying or crediting you with the amount of the rebate, fill out Form GST190, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Houses Purchased from a Builder, Form RC7190-WS, GST190 Calculation Worksheet, and, if you are eligible for the Ontario new housing rebate, Form RC7190-ON, GST190 Ontario Rebate Schedule. In this case, you may be able to use either Application Type 2 or 5.


Application Type 2
Where the builder is not paying or crediting you with the amount of the rebate, use Application Type 2 if:

you bought a floating home from a builder
you bought a mobile home from a builder, and you are claiming a rebate for:
only the mobile home and you are not claiming a rebate for any qualifying land or improvements. (For example, you may not have paid tax on your purchase of the land. In this case, no rebate would be available for the land)
the mobile home and the qualifying land that you also bought from the builder under the same written agreement for the purchase of the mobile home (if you are claiming a rebate for the mobile home and also for qualifying land that you bought under a separate agreement from the mobile home, see Option 3)
the mobile home where you are leasing a site in a residential trailer park from the dealer. (See the definition of a residential trailer park. If you are leasing land from the dealer but it is not in a residential trailer park, do not use Application Type 2. Use Type 5 instead)





Application Type 5
Where the builder is not paying or crediting you with the amount of the rebate, use Application Type 5 if:

you bought a mobile home
you are leasing the qualifying land from the builder under the same written agreement to purchase the mobile home
the land is not a site in a residential trailer park
the lease of the land is for 20 years or more, or gives you the option to buy the land

If the land is a site in a residential trailer park, do not use Application Type 5. Use Type 2 instead.
In the case of a floating home, use Application Type 2.
If you choose Option 2, you can calculate your rebate based only on the items the dealer sold you (for example, the floating home or the mobile home and qualifying land, if the home and the land are sold under the same written agreement, and also for improvements to that land).
Option 2 is not to your advantage if you paid the GST/HST to someone other than the dealer for the land or any improvements made to the land, or if you paid the GST/HST on other qualifying items not purchased from the dealer. In this case, see Option 3 below.


Option 3
This is the best option if you paid the GST/HST to the dealer on the purchase of the mobile home or floating home and you also paid the GST/HST to the dealer under a separate agreement or to someone other than the dealer for the qualifying land (generally up to one-half hectare) or for improvements to your land or mobile or floating home.
Fill out Form GST191-WS, Construction Summary Worksheet and Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses, and, if you are eligible for the Ontario new housing rebate, Form RC7190-ON, GST190 Ontario Rebate Schedule. For more information on items that qualify for the rebate, see Owner-built houses. You cannot claim a rebate for any GST/HST paid on furnishings, free-standing appliances, legal costs related to leasing the land, or on services related to maintaining the mobile or floating home.


Bed and breakfast and similar establishments
As an individual who bought or built a bed and breakfast or other establishment providing short-term accommodation to the public, you may be eligible for the GST/HST new housing rebate if one of the following conditions is met:

you bought a new or substantially renovated house from a builder, whether you bought the land or lease it from the builder, and the house includes rooms that are to be rented for short-term accommodation to individuals as a place of residence or lodging
you built or substantially renovated your house, or carried out a major addition along with the renovation of the existing house, and the house includes rooms that are to be rented for short-term accommodation to individuals as a place of residence or lodging

Generally, short-term accommodation means housing that is supplied by way of lease, licence, or similar arrangement for the purpose of its occupancy by an individual as a place of residence or lodging. The period throughout which the same individual is given continuous occupancy is less than one month.
You also have to meet the other eligibility conditions. For example, to be eligible for a rebate on the whole house, more than 50% of the house (including the bed and breakfast) has to be used as your primary place of residence or that of your relation, either individually or in combination.
If 50% or less of the house that includes the bed and breakfast is used as your primary place of residence or that of your relation, only the part that is your primary place of residence or that of your relation will be eligible for the new housing rebate.
You also have to tick the box called "Bed and breakfast" in Part C of Form GST190, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Houses Purchased from a Builder, or Form GST191, GST/HST New Housing Rebate Application for Owner-Built Houses.

Do you know you can reduce your income taxes for the year you buy a home? It’s true. If you, your spouse or common-law partner haven’t owned a home that you've lived in, in the past 4 years, or haven’t ever owned one, you may qualify for the First-Time Home Buyers’ Tax Credit (HBTC). It's also called the Home Buyers’ Amount.  
What's the HBTC?
The HBTC is a federal non-refundable tax credit. It encourages Canadians to enter the real estate market by making home buying more affordable. The purchased home must be in Canada and registered with the appropriate land registry office — in your name, or in your and your spouse's or common-law partner's names.  
Do I qualify as a first-time home buyer?
You may be surprised to find out who qualifies as a first-time home buyer. Eligible people sometimes miss out on the tax benefits. They assume the HBTC only applies to those who've never owned a home. Not so. If you haven’t owned a home in the past 4 years, you may also qualify for the benefits.  
Do I qualify for the HBTC if I claim a disability amount on my taxes?
You may qualify for the HBTC if you claim a disability amount the year you buy a home — even if you aren’t a first-time home buyer. If you help a relative with a disability buy a home to live in, you may also qualify.  
How much can I claim?
You and your spouse or common-law partner can claim a combined $10,000. At a 15% tax rate — the lowest income tax rate — the $10,000 claim equals a one-time $1,500 tax reduction. You can apply the whole $10,000 credit on your tax return, or share it with your spouse or common-law partner.  
This is a non-refundable credit and will reduce the amount of taxes you owe by $750. If you don’t owe income tax the year you buy the home, there’s no benefit to claiming the HBTC.  
What properties qualify for the HBTC?
Almost all types of properties you buy as your main residence in Canada qualify for the HBTC, including:

Single-family houses
Semi-detached houses
Townhouses
Mobile homes
Condo units
Apartments in duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes or apartment buildings
An ownership share in a housing co-op that gives you an equity interest in the co-op  

Homes under construction also qualify. You must move into the finished property within one year of the purchase closing date.  
Before you buy a home or property, look for other money-saving tools or programs like the HBTC. Other Canadian government initiatives include the First Home Savings Account (FHSA) and the Home Buyers’ Plan (HBP) Opens in a dialog., which allow you to withdraw money without triggering tax if you follow plan guidelines. When choosing a mortgage, a larger mortgage payment amount and shorter amortization periodOpens in a popup. can also save you money. These reduce the interest amount you pay on the principal.

In nearly every province in Canada (with the exception of Alberta and Saskatchewan), when you purchase a property, youâll be required to pay a percentage of the property value as a lump sum once the transaction has closed. For more detailed information on how land transfer tax is calculated in each province, see our guide below. How do I avoid paying land transfer tax?If you acquire property in Alberta or Saskatchewan, you can avoid paying land transfer tax, as it is not charged by either province.Â 
If you are acquiring property elsewhere in Canada, you can typically avoid paying land transfer taxes under the following circumstances:

The property is being transferred from a parent to a child.
The property is being transferred between spouses.
The property is being transferred from a person to a family business.
The property is a farm property being transferred between family members.

Please note that the above list is not exhaustive, and you should always get specific details from your local provincial government or seek counsel from an expert (e.g. an accountant) before determining that you do not have to pay land transfer taxes. Is there a land transfer tax rebate?There are land transfer rebates available in some provinces. In Ontario, for example, there is a land transfer rebate of up to $4,000 available to first-time home buyers. Similarly, in British Columbia, first-time home buyers are eligible to receive a full land transfer tax refund on homes up to $500,000, and a partial refund on homes from $500,000 - $525,000. In other provinces, like Quebec and Manitoba, there are no land transfer rebates.Â

Land transfer tax (LTT) is often overlooked when considering the total cost of purchasing a home. All provinces have a land transfer tax, except Alberta and Saskatchewan, who instead levy a much smaller transfer fee. In most provinces the tax is calculated as a percentage of property value, using asking price as a close estimate. Home buyers in Toronto, however, also incur an additional municipal tax.
To help offset the cost, Ontario, British Columbia, Prince Edward Island and the City of Toronto offer land transfer tax rebates for first-time home buyers.
How to calculate land transfer tax
Land transfer taxes are calculated based on the purchase price of your property. Each province sets its own land transfer tax rates, as do some municipalities. Use the calculator above to find the land transfer tax based on your location, or keep reading to find out how land transfer tax is calculated where you live.
 
Ontario land transfer tax1
Ontario land transfer tax rates were last updated in 2017. This change introduced a $2 million tax bracket, but left the marginal rates and cutoffs for the lowest four price brackets unchanged. A non-resident speculation tax of 15% was also added for the Greater Golden Horseshoe Region.

The purchase price of the property
The amount listed on the Deed of Sale
The market value of the property determined by a municipal assessment roll increased by a comparative factor

Yukon Territory Land Titles Act18
Fee #1: Assurance Fees
This fee is only applicable if your purchase price is greater than the value of the property at the time of its last transfer, in which case you would incur the following fees:
â¢ $20 for: First $10,000 of additional declared value
â¢ $10 for: Each additional $10,000 onwards of additional declared value
For example, if you recently purchased a property for $100,000 but its value at the time of the last transfer was $80,000, there will be an additional $20,000 of declared value. Therefore, your assurance fee will be $30 ($20 on the first $10,000 and $10 on the remaining $10,000).
Fee #2: Transfer Fees
When purchasing a property, you will also need to pay a flat title transfer fee, which will depend on the purchase price of your property. See the rates below to find the fee that applies to the value of your property.

However, the 2022 federal budget announcement proposed a two-year ban on foreign homebuyers altogether. This ban starts on January 2023. When the foreign buyer ban is effective, the NRST won’t be relevant as those who aren’t citizens or permanent residents won’t be able to buy residential property in Canada. However, when foreign investment is welcome to Canada again, NRST will likely continue to apply.The calculators and content on this page are provided for general information purposes only.

The low-down on purchasing a home on leased land


When purchasing a home, unless it’s a condo or apartment, you will also typically own the property on which the home resides. However, this is not always the case.   Another option that exists for homeowners is to purchase a home on leased land - a relevant topic due to the amount of land owned by First Nations Bands in West Kelowna. 



For most people, the idea of purchasing a home on leased land comes with some concerns as there are several important factors to consider with these agreements. However, not all of these differences are negative, especially when developers take extra steps to minimize the potential risks.   How does leased land work? Essentially, purchasing a home on leased land means that you own the home but not the land on which is resides. This land is owned by some other person or entity, such as a First Nations Band. "Lease land should be looked at like a leased property; a contractual obligation is signed between the 'landlord' and 'tenant' for the use of the property given period of time," said Susann Czekus, Sales Manager at West Harbour, a community which resides on leased land in West Kelowna. The leases are long-term, often 50-100 years long. The homeowner must pay monthly lease fees or pay for the lease upfront, and can often negotiate a new lease once the current term ends.   Because the property isn’t being purchased, leasehold homes are often significantly less expensive than a similar freehold home would be, which means that homeowners are able to purchase their ideal home in a location that they could not normally afford.     Leasehold properties are usually expansive and contain several homes within one community. This may grant homeowners access to shared amenities like landscaping, maintenance, pools, tennis courts and so on. These luxuries may be accompanied by Homeowners Association fees, similar to strata fees.   So, why are home buyers hesitant? The main concerns are the lack of equity being built due to not owning the property, the fear of what could happen once the term is up, and potentially significant lease fees. As well, it can be difficult to find another buyer if you decide to sell once the lease is closer to its end.   While there are financial benefits to purchasing on leased land, and doing so may enable buyers to purchase a home and have access to amenities they could never afford otherwise, these concerns are still very valid. Some communities, such as West Harbour in West Kelowna, have taken extra precautions to minimize these concerns for homebuyers.   Purchasing a home at West Harbour West Harbour is a community in West Kelowna on Westbank First Nation leased land. As a well-recognized band across Canada, Westbank First Nation has several leased land agreements, including agreements with large corporations like Walmart, London Drugs and Canadian Tire.   The homes at West Harbour include a 99 year prepaid lease agreement, which means there are no monthly payments necessary. As well, the leases are all registered with the federal government, which means that there is no way that the land can be repossesed by the landowner during the time of the lease.    "Buyers may be concerned that since they do not have fee-simple ownership of the land, the lessor has the right to terminate the lease at any given time before the lease expires," said Czekus. "Here at West Harbour, buyers do not need to be concerned as the lease is a federally-registered, pre-paid lease."  Something else that makes West Harbour unique is their Legacy Fund, which they have created to help ease concerns regarding what happens at the end of the lease. For each home purchased, West Harbour invests $5,000 into a fund which is transferable with homeownership. If the market performs similarly over the next 99 years as it has in the past, then whoever owns the home in year 99 should have access to roughly $3.4 million that they can use to renegotiate the lease or use as they please. "The Legacy Fund is a brilliant way to protect the value of the land and give buyers peace of mind," said Czekus. "With each home purchase, our developer deposits $5,000 into an investment fund. This investment, over the period of 99 years, will grow into a substantial amount of money, so when the lease comes up for renewal the buyers will have the funds to do that. Or, if the community decides not to do so, they will be able to take that money and invest in a home elsewhere."  "This is very important information to know in the case of the resale, as well," added Czekus. "Let's say there is only 15 years left before the expiry of the lease. In a regular land lease situation, the buyer may not even consider buying the property knowing the costly lease renewal is coming up in a short period of time. But with the funds in place, it will be a different scenario." In addition to the fund, buyers at West Harbour can save thousands of dollars in taxes as they do not have to pay PST, GST, property transfer taxes and are also not obligated to pay the new speculation tax. To put this in perspective, on a $800,000 home, the tax savings from PST, GST and PTT are roughly $55,000.  As well, those who live at West Harbour are able to enjoy detached, lakefront homes with access to several resort-style amenities, including an outdoor pool and hot tub, private marina and clubhouse complete with a fitness room and tennis courts.  Purchasing a home is a big decision, so it’s important to do your research and consider all the available options. This is just a brief overview of leased land agreements. While owning on leased land isn’t for everyone, for some it can be a great way to achieve their ideal lifestyle.   If you’d like to learn more about owning a home at West Harbour, contact the sales centre at 250-763-6622 or visit the presentation centre at 1825 Viewpoint Drive, open from 12 pm to 4 pm Saturday through Wednesday.   West Harbour is a lakefront community of designer homes by Troika Developments in West Kelowna, just a short drive away from downtown Kelowna, the Westside Wine Trail and several amenities. The community itself has its own private beach, outdoor pool, fitness facility and marina.   NowMedia sponsored content is written and posted in partnership with participating businesses.

Effective October 25, 2022, the NRST rate is 25%.The NRST is applied to the value of the consideration for a conveyance. See the Land Transfer Tax page for information about the value of the consideration. For information on calculating the value of the consideration on the purchase of a newly constructed home, please see Determining the Value of the Consideration for Transfers of New Homes.The NRST applies in addition to the general Land Transfer Tax (LTT) in Ontario. It does not apply on top of the LTT.If you entered into your agreement of purchase and sale to buy a home or you entered into an assignment of the agreement of purchase and sale on or before October 24, 2022, you may be subject to a lower rate of NRST or you may not have to pay the NRST. For more information, see our page Non-Resident Speculation Tax transitional provisions.Entities subject to NRSTThe NRST applies to foreign entities or taxable trustees who purchase or acquire residential property in Ontario. The persons purchasing or acquiring land are referred to as transferees.Effective from January 1, 2023, to December 31, 2024, the Government of Canada has implemented a prohibition on the purchase of certain residential property in Canada by non-Canadians. The prohibition is a federal measure that operates separately from Ontario’s Non-Resident Speculation Tax (NRST).  Persons who are subject to an exception under the federal prohibition may not be exempt from Ontario’s NRST. NRST is payable unless all of the requirements for an NRST exemption are met. Further information about the federal prohibition may be found on the CMHC website: Prohibition on the Purchase of Residential Property by Non-Canadians Act.A foreign entity is either a foreign national or a foreign corporation.A foreign national, as defined in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Canada), is an individual who is not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada.A permanent resident means a person who has acquired permanent resident status under section 46 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (Canada) and has not subsequently lost that status. The phrase permanent resident of Canada does NOT refer to whether or not you reside in Canada.The expiry of your permanent resident card does not mean you lost permanent resident status. In Canada, permanent resident status can only be lost through an official process. If Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada has revoked your permanent resident status, without having issued you Canadian citizenship, then you will be a foreign national who is subject to NRST. For more information, refer to the Government of Canada’s webpage on “Understand permanent resident status”.If you have applied to become a permanent resident of Canada, but you have not obtained that status at the time your home transaction closes, you must pay NRST unless you are eligible for an exemption. If you become a permanent resident of Canada after the home transaction closes, you may qualify for a rebate of the NRST if you meet specific requirements. Please see our Non-Resident Speculation Tax rebates and refunds page.If you are a Canadian citizen who buys residential property alone or exclusively along with other citizens or permanent residents of Canada, you will not be subject to NRST. It is not relevant whether any of the citizens or permanent residents of Canada live in Canada. Whether a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada is considered a "non-resident" for income tax purposes is not relevant for the NRST.A foreign corporation is a corporation that is one of the following:a corporation that is not incorporated in Canadaa corporation, the shares of which are not listed on a stock exchange in Canada, that is incorporated in Canada and is controlled, directly or indirectly in any manner whatever, within the meaning of section 256 of the Income Tax Act (Canada), by one or more of the following:a foreign nationala corporation that is not incorporated in Canadaa corporation that is controlled, directly or indirectly, under section 256 of the Income Tax Act (Canada)  by one or a group of foreign entitiesControl of a corporation (for NRST purposes) includes both de jure control (who owns the shares that carry the voting rights to elect the majority of the board of directors) and de facto control (whether a person, despite not having the requisite share ownership, nonetheless has a right and ability to effect a significant change in the board of directors or to influence in a very direct way the shareholders who would otherwise have the ability to elect the board of directors). If the corporate documents are set up such that a foreign entity has the ability to elect the board of directors of the corporation, then the corporation is a foreign corporation.A taxable trustee means either a trustee of:a trust with at least one trustee that is a foreign entitya trust with no foreign entity trustees if a beneficiary of the trust is a foreign entityTaxable trustee does not include a trustee acting for the following types of trusts:a mutual fund trust within the meaning of subsection 132 (6) of the Income Tax Act (Canada)a real estate investment trust as defined in subsection 122.1 (1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada)a SIFT trust as defined in subsection 122.1 (1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada)Types of property subject to NRSTThe NRST applies to the transfer of "designated land", which is land that contains at least one and not more than six single family residences. Examples of land containing one single family residence include a detached house, a semi-detached house, a townhouse or a residential condominium unit. Examples of designated land containing more than one single family residence include duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, fiveplexes and sixplexes. For the purposes of the NRST, single family residences include cottages, cabins and other similar structures that are designed for occupation as the residence of a family, whether or not that family has a residence elsewhere and whether or not the structure is habitable for only part of the year. The zoning designation of the land is irrelevant for establishing whether a structure is a single family residence. Single family residences do not include a residence on agricultural land that is eligible to be classified in the farm property class prescribed under the Assessment Act.Since a residential condominium unit and each of the structures described above are designated land for the purposes of the NRST, there would be a transfer of designated land if multiple units and/or structures are transferred together under a single conveyance. As an example, if two fourplexes are transferred under a single conveyance, there would be a transfer of designated land and the NRST may be applicable. If seven or more residential condominium units are transferred under a single conveyance, there is a transfer of designated land and the NRST may be applicable.The NRST does not apply to other types of land such as land containing multi-residential rental apartment buildings with more than six units, agricultural land, commercial land or industrial land.The NRST applies on the value of the consideration for the residential property. If the land transferred includes residential property and land used for non-residential purposes, the NRST applies on the portion of the value of the consideration attributable to the residential property. Take for example a transaction where the value of the consideration is $3,000,000 and the land contains:one single family residence with a value of the consideration of $1,400,000land used for commercial purposes with a value of the consideration of $1,600,000In the above example, the NRST would apply to only the $1,400,000 portion.A reasonable self-assessment is required by taxpayers in apportioning the value of the consideration for the purposes of the NRST. Apportionment is only available if the non-residential property is used for non-residential purposes exclusively. The taxpayer must be able to demonstrate that this portion of the land is used for non-residential purposes, such as commercial activity. The apportionment would be based on the value of the consideration that is attributable to the residential property as compared to the non‑residential property, not the square footage of the two.Who pays NRSTThe NRST applies to the value of the consideration for the transfer of residential property if any one of the transferees is a foreign entity or taxable trustee. For example, if a transfer of residential property is made to three transferees, one of whom is a foreign entity that acquires a 33% share in the land, the NRST would apply to 100% of the value of the consideration for the transfer.As an example, Tomoko, Shoshana, and Lieven buy a home together. Tomoko acquires 33%, Shoshana acquires 33% and Lieven acquires 34% interest, with a value of the consideration of $1,500,000. Tomoko and Shoshana are Canadian citizens, but Lieven is a foreign national. The NRST is applied to the full value of the consideration, resulting in NRST payable of $375,000. They do not pay NRST on just 34% of the value of the consideration. The NRST is not prorated to the interest acquired by the foreign national.Each transferee is liable for any NRST payable. If a foreign entity or taxable trustee does not pay the NRST, the other transferees will be required to pay the tax. This applies even if the other transferees are Canadian citizens, permanent residents of Canada or non-foreign corporations.Exemptions from the NRSTAn exemption from NRST may be available for registered transfers if the transferee is a nominee, a protected person or a spouse of a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident of Canada, a nominee or a protected person. Exemptions in the Act and its regulations that apply to LTT also apply to the NRST.Supporting documentation may be required by the ministry to substantiate all claims for an NRST exemption.To learn more, refer to our page on: Transfers that are exempt from the NRST.Rebate and refund of the NRSTA rebate of the NRST, may be available for registered transfers if the transferee becomes a permanent resident of Canada.  If the land purchased is within the Greater Golden Horseshoe Region of Ontario, and if a binding agreement of purchase and sale was signed on or before March 29, 2022, and not assigned to other persons after March 29, 2022, then a foreign national may qualify for the International Student NRST Rebate or the Foreign National Working in Ontario NRST Rebate.A refund of the NRST may be available for eligible transferees if the tax has been improperly paid or overpaid.Supporting documentation will be required to substantiate all applications for a rebate or refund.To learn more, refer to our NRST rebates and refunds webpage.Tax avoidance and offencesAll transfers of land in Ontario are subject to audit.Anti-avoidance provisions will be enforced to ensure the NRST is reported and paid as required. This includes examining circumstances where Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada, as taxable trustees, hold property in trust for a foreign entity. This also includes preventing the use of multiple conveyances to avoid the NRST.Failure to pay the NRST as required may result in a penalty, fine and/or imprisonment.InterestNRST interest is compounded daily and interest rates are reset every 3 months.Interest on an NRST rebate or refund begins to accrue 40 business days after a complete NRST rebate or refund application has been received by the ministry.

Understanding the Vacant Home Tax
By Mirjana (Mira) Markovic
Find our previous article on this topic here.
Effective January 1, 2023, the City of Toronto and the City of Ottawa both passed bylaws to introduce a new tax for vacant homes/units. These bylaws require residential homeowners to declare the occupancy status of their properties annually. The Vacant Home Tax Property Status Declaration (“Declaration”) shall determine whether the Vacant Home Tax (“VHT”) applies and is payable. Properties that are vacant for more than 6 months in the prior taxation year will be subject to a tax of 1% of the property’s assessed value in the current year contingent to exemptions as defined by the Vacant Home/Unit Tax Bylaw for the City of Toronto. The goal behind introducing such a tax is to increase the supply of housing by discouraging owners from leaving their residential properties unoccupied.
Types Property Status Declaration
 
The chart below outlines status of a property and whether the VHT is applicable.




Property Status


Description


 Does VHT Apply?




Principal residence


Any housing unit owned by the taxpayer, which he or she, or someone related to that taxpayer, ordinarily inhabited during a particular year, and is designated as a principal residence at the time of sale. (Section 54, Income Tax Act)


NO




Occupied as a principal residence of a permitted occupant.


A permitted occupant includes but is not limited to a family member or a friend of the registered owner.


NO




Tenanted property


Occupied by an individual(s) who has/have a written lease agreement for a term of at least thirty (30) days.


NO




Vacant with an eligible exemption


Exemptions:

Death of a registered owner (property vacant for six (6) months or more in the previous year due to death of owner;
Repair/renovation;
Principal resident is in long-term supportive care, or hospital for up to six (6) during taxation year (this can be claimed for two (2) consecutive taxation years)
Transfer of legal ownership;
Occupancy for full-time employment (vacant property required for occupation for employment purposes for at least six (6) months of the taxation year;
Court Order (court order prohibits occupancy)



NO




Vacant, deemed or determined vacant


Homeowner can declare property vacant through the property status declaration; a property will be deemed vacant if property status declaration is not completed; a property will be determined vacant if selected for an audit.


YES




Deadline to file the Vacant Home Tax Property Status Declaration
Deadlines to file for the year 2022 are as follows:

For Toronto: The declaration must be filed by February 2, 2023
For Ottawa: The declaration must be filed by April 30, 2023.
For transactions closing between January 1 and the date the annual declaration is due

(Toronto – February 2; Ottawa – April 30), the seller must file the declaration before closing.
Implications for property transactions, both for purchasers and sellers:
Both purchasers and sellers are obligated to make the appropriate arrangements to file the Declaration. If sellers fail to file the said Declaration, the VHT shall form a lien on their property, and any unpaid taxes shall become the purchaser’s responsibility.
Please note that if a closing occurs between January 1st and February 2nd, the seller is obligated to complete the Declaration prior to the closing because only the seller will know the property occupancy status for the prior year. However, if a closing occurs after the Declaration period (February 3rd to December 31st), the purchaser must submit a Declaration in the following year. In this case, the purchaser qualifies for the “transfer of legal ownership exemption” indicated above.
The seller is required to provide a copy of the completed and filed Declaration to the purchaser along with a statutory declaration at closing confirming the filed Declaration is true and correct.
The bylaw continues to be a work in progress and professionals have noted several areas which have not yet been addressed. Some of these areas include but are not limited to the following: a) The VHT does not apply to tenant property that have a written lease agreement for a term of at least thirty (30) days. What about the myriad properties located in Toronto that do not have a written lease? Does the VHT apply?; b) What about Airbnb? These establishments may be occupied for most of the year however, the leases are less than 30 days; c) What about individuals who are in long-term care or a hospital? It appears that these individuals are exempt from VHT if they are in any of the said facilities for up to six (6) months but if over six (6) months then the VHT would apply.
I except that these bylaws will require further amendment in order to provide more concreate guidelines on properties that are subject to and exempt from VHT.

You’re probably already familiar with the fundamental concept of obtaining a loan to become a homeowner. But in reality a mortgage is a rather complex marathon of financial calculations, comparing offers, and various approval stages.
In this article we’ll explore mortgages in depth, and in simple, comprehensible terms. We’ll go over the mortgage process from start to finish, where to look for the best rates, and the vocabulary you’ll need along the way.

 


   What is a mortgage? A mortgage is a loan that can be used to purchase property, which in turn acts as security for the loan. A mortgage tends to be for a large sum and is usually paid off over 25 or 30 years. When you sign up for a mortgage, you’re agreeing to make regular payments. These mortgage payments are comprised of both principal and interest. When a payment is made, it’s first used to cover the interest, then the principal. A mortgage lets the mortgage lender take possession of the property should you fail to make the agreed-upon payments on time.  The mortgage process Once you’ve decided you’d like to buy a home, the next step is to figure out how to pay for it. Unfortunately, most of us don’t have the cash saved up to buy a home outright. That’s where a mortgage comes in handy. Read: How to save money for a house Before searching for a property, it’s a good idea to get pre-approved for a mortgage. When you’re pre-approved, you’ll know exactly how much you can afford to spend on a home. You also reduce your risk since you’re a lot less likely to make an offer on a home you can’t afford. (I’ll talk about the pre-approval process in greater detail later on.) Once you’re pre-approved, you can go shopping for a home. It’s helpful to make a list of needs and wants. That way you can objectively look at each home when deciding if it’s right for you. Once you find a home you like, you’ll put in an offer. Once your offer is accepted, you’ll work with your banker or mortgage broker (read our brokers vs. banks article if you’re not sure which to go with) to get the mortgage approval. You’ll need to provide documents and information. The lender will then sign off on everything if they’re good and you can remove condition of financing from your offer (if applicable).  How do you know it’s time? When is a good time to buy a home and take out a mortgage? A good time is when you’re personally and financially ready. That means you have a steady job, you’re settled in your personal life, and you’re committed to staying put in the same place for the next five or 10 years. Read: Should you rent or buy? When applying for a mortgage, the lender wants to make sure you can afford it on a monthly basis. The lender does this with two debt ratios: the Gross Debt Service (GDS) Ratio and the Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio. The GDS Ratio looks at the percentage of your gross monthly income needed to cover expenses related to the home: your mortgage payments, property taxes, heating and maintenance fees (if applicable). Most lenders are looking for a GDS Ratio below 39%. The TDS Ratio is similar to the GDS Ratio. It looks at all the same things as the GDS Ratio, however, it also factors in any other debt that you might have. If it’s revolving debt, such as credit card debt or a line of credit, 3% of the outstanding balance is usually used for debt servicing purposes. If it’s an installment loan with a fixed payment (i.e., a car loan, car lease, or personal loan), the payment is used for debt servicing purposes. Most lenders are looking for a TDS Ratio below 44%. It should be noted that the mortgage payments used in these calculations are higher than you’re actually paying. That’s because the payments are calculated using the inflated stress test rate (currently at 4.79%). While the GDS and TDS Ratios include some important homeownership expenses, it’s important to also factor in any other big expenses you may have, such as childcare expenses.  Where can I get a mortgage? There are several routes you can take when hunting for a mortgage, including going to a bank or credit union, or working with a mortgage broker. Bank As you shop for a mortgage, your gut instinct is probably to go to your local bank branch where you have your chequing account. Banks offer a suite of products and it might be convenient for you to hold all your important finances in the same place. And some banks will offer you extra perks for bundling your mortgage with another product. Read: The benefits of bundling bank products That said, if you simply get a mortgage with the existing bank you use for chequing and savings, you might miss out on a more competitive rate that’s offered elsewhere. The mortgage market is very dynamic and it’s always a good idea to shop around. I recommend also checking out the mortgage rates offered by virtual banks (sometimes referred to as ‘direct banks’), like Tangerine Mortgage. Virtual banks don’t have physical branches, and their substantially lower overhead costs typically allow them to offer more competitive mortgage deals than traditional banks, particularly for long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Virtual banks will also sometimes offer bundling deals, so even if you don’t bank with a brick-and-mortar institution, there are still mortage deals for you to jump on. Apply for a mortgage with Tangerine. Mortgage broker Another way to shop around is through a mortgage broker. An independent mortgage broker has access to dozens of lenders and can provide you with unbiased advice. Even if you end up choosing your local bank branch in the end, at least you’ll have peace of mind knowing you got a good deal. Online mortgage broker The benefit of an online mortgage broker is that they likely have access to many more lenders than your local broker would. The more options you have, the more flexibility you get. With multiple lender options, you’re also likely to find a better rate. Not only that, but if you’ve been denied a mortgage from your bank in the past, you can still search for one through online mortgage brokers. Homewise is a digital mortgage solution that helps you find the best mortgage options from over 30 banks and lenders. You’ll get support from a personal advisor at every step of the way, including understanding the fine print of your offers. The service is free and the process is done online, 24/7, in all of five minutes. Breezeful is an online mortgage broker that makes it quick and painless to shop around for different lenders. With an online database of over 30 lenders, Breezeful works to match you with one that best suits your particular needs. You’ll get some of the lowest rates possible, all from the comfort of your own home and faster than your normal, brick-and-mortar banks. Read: Questions you must ask your mortgage broker  Important terms to know Pre-qualification: This is ideal when you’re only thinking about buying a home. A lender will collect basic information about your finances and then give you an approximate figure for how much they’d potentially be willing to lend you to buy a property. Pre-approval: Getting pre-approved for a mortgage is more formal than pre-qualifying. In this stage a lender will verify the financial information you provide them and run a credit check. If you’re pre-approved it indicates that the lender is committed to providing you with a loan, though the final amount they’re willing to lend you and the terms of the mortgage are subject to change based on an actual property valuation as well as market fluctuations. The mortgage stress test: This is a calculation of whether you can still afford to pay your mortgage in the event that rates increase. The results of this stress test will determine your qualifications for the mortgage you’re looking to take and applies to all home buyers, including those who make a 20% down payment on their home. Down payment: This is the amount of money you’re required to pay upfront when buying real estate. The bigger your down payment, the smaller the mortgage you’ll need. The size of your down payment depends on the purchase price of your home. For example, if you spend less than $500,000 on a home, you’re only required to put 5% of the purchase price down. Mortgage rate: This is the interest rate you’ll pay on your mortgage. This will determine how much you pay in interest over the life of your mortgage. Your mortgage rate may change depending on if it’s fixed or variable (more on that below). Closing costs: These are expenses that you’re required to pay out of pocket leading up to your closing date. Examples of closing costs include real estate lawyer fees, land transfer taxes, a home inspection, and movers. It’s a good idea to budget between 1.5% and 4% of a home’s purchase price towards closing costs.  Different types of mortgages Insured, insurable, and uninsurable There are three main types of mortgages: insured, insurable, and uninsurable. An insured or high-ratio mortgage is when you’re required to pay mortgage default insurance that protects the lender. Because of that, most lenders offer their lowest mortgage rates on these products (although this is offset by the mortgage default insurance you’ll pay). An insurable or conventional mortgage is when you make at least a 20% down payment on a home. In this case, you aren’t required to pay mortgage insurance. This saves you money, but because it’s slightly riskier for lenders you’ll most often pay a higher mortgage rate than an insured mortgage. An uninsured mortgage is a mortgage that doesn’t meet the government’s guidelines to be insured by any of the mortgage insurers. Examples include home purchases over $1 million and 30-year amortizations. Because of this, uninsurable mortgages tend to come with the highest mortgage rate. Term vs. amortization A mortgage term is the length of time the terms and conditions of your mortgage are guaranteed. If you have a fixed-rate mortgage, your mortgage rate will remain the same for the duration of the time. The mortgage amortization is how long it will take you to pay off your mortgage in full. The standard length in Canada is 25 years, although there’s nothing stopping you from choosing a shorter or longer term (as long as you can pass the stress test). Open vs. closed An open mortgage lets you repay the mortgage in full at any point during your mortgage term. Because of this, it tends to come with a higher mortgage rate. Open mortgages only tend to make sense if you expect a huge cash windfall or intend to sell your home in the near future. A closed mortgage has limitations on how much extra money you can put towards your mortgage beyond your regular mortgage payments. Because of that it tends to come with a lower mortgage rate than an open mortgage. Fixed vs. variable With a fixed-rate mortgage, your mortgage rate and payment amount remain the same during your mortgage term. With a variable rate mortgage, your mortgage rate and payment may change during your mortgage term depending on changes in a lender’s prime rate. Fixed mortgages tend to come with a higher mortgage rate than variable mortgages since you’re paying for the stability of knowing exactly what your mortgage rate and payment will be.  What do lenders look at when approving you for a mortgage? Lenders consider several factors when deciding whether to approve your mortgage application. They look at your income, down payment, assets, debts, credit, and the property itself. Income Lenders are looking for borrowers with a stable source of income. You’ll need to be able to prove that your income is sufficient to regularly make mortgage payments. If you’re a full-time salaried employee, you’ll be golden in the eyes of most lenders. If you’re an hourly employee whose hours are guaranteed, lenders like that as well. If you’re a full-time or part-time hourly employee whose hours are not guaranteed or you’re working on contract, you’ll typically need two years of income in order for a lender to consider your income (lenders will do a two-year average). For proof of income, you’ll usually need to provide a letter of employment, recent paystub, T4s, and notices of assessment for the last two years. If you’re self-employed usually you can still get a mortgage, however, you’ll need to provide more documentation. Since the income from your own business is less stable than a full-time salaried position in the eyes of lenders, typically you’ll need to be in business for a minimum of two years and provide Personal T1 Generals, Notices of Assessment and Corporate Financial Statements (if applicable) for the two most recent years. Down payment If the down payment funds are from a bank account, the lender will usually want to see a 90-day transaction history. If the funds are from investments or RRSPs, you’ll usually need to provide three monthly statements. If it’s from the sale of another property, you’ll usually need to provide a copy of the signed purchase agreement and a recent mortgage statement (if the property you’ve sold already has a mortgage). If you’re receiving gifted funds, the lender will usually request a signed gift letter and want to see proof that the funds have been transferred to your bank account. Assets You’ll need to provide the lender with a summary of your assets, including chequing accounts, savings accounts, TFSAs, RRSPs, non-registered accounts, and vehicles. Although assets aren’t included in the calculation of your debt ratios, having substantial assets proves to the lender that you’re a responsible borrower. Imagine if someone has been earning $200,000 a year for 10 years, but doesn’t have any assets at all. It would raise a red flag with lenders. Has the borrower been spending every penny that they earn? Debts and credit Debts and credit are related to each other. A lender looks at the types of credit you have, considers the outstanding balances and the payment status and also considers your credit score and credit history when evaluating you as a borrower. This information is found on a borrower’s credit report, which a lender must obtain your written permission to access. A lender is generally looking for a borrower with a credit score above 670 or 680 with no late or delinquent payments. However, if you have late payments, or, in some cases, if you’ve filed for bankruptcy or a consumer proposal, you may still be able to get a mortgage. A lender will usually want to know the reason why you have a credit blemish. If it’s due to life circumstances outside your control (e.g. you got sick or were laid off from work and fell behind on bills) and you can prove you’re a responsible borrower otherwise, you may still be able to get a mortgage. The property The last thing lenders consider is the property itself. This is done by way of an appraisal. Depending on the property and where it’s located, some lenders may use an automated valuation model (AVM) to determine the value of your property. (This is when a lender doesn’t need to visit your property to determine its value.) Other lenders may request a full appraisal. The property appraisal confirms the property is worth what you paid for it. It also lets the lender know the condition of the property.  What to consider when shopping for a mortgage While the mortgage rate certainly matters when shopping for a mortgage, it shouldn’t be the only factor you consider. Are you going to break your mortgage? When you sign up for a mortgage, breaking it is probably the last thing on your mind. But a lot can happen during the standard, five-year mortgage term. If you think there’s a chance you might need to break your mortgage during your mortgage term, it’s a good idea to go with a lender and mortgage type with a lower mortgage penalty. Variable rate mortgages tend to have lower penalties than fixed rate. How will you be penalized if you break your mortgage? If you end up breaking your mortgage during your mortgage term to buy a new home, you may be able to avoid mortgage penalties by porting your mortgage. Porting your mortgage means moving your mortgage with you to the new property. Some lenders have more flexible portability policies than others. One lender may only give you 30 days to port your mortgage, whereas another gives you 90 days. You’ll want to ask a lender about the specifics of its portability policy if that’s important to you. What about prepayments? If you want to aggressively pay down your mortgage, prepayments are a must. Prepayments generally come in three forms: regular payment increases, doubling up, and lump-sum payments. Not all lenders offer the same prepayments. For example, one lender might only let you make 10% lump-sum payments and increase your mortgage payment by 10% per year, while another may let you make 15% lump-sum payments and increase your payment by 15% per year. By choosing the lender with the right prepayments for you, you can pay down your mortgage at the pace you want without incurring a penalty for making too many extra payments.  Final word As you can see, there are a lot more things to consider when shopping for a mortgage than just the mortgage rate. The mortgage process can be stressful, but it doesn’t have to be. After reading this article you should be better prepared the next time you apply for a mortgage. By knowing exactly what mortgage lenders will be looking at, where you should look and what you should expect, the process will go a lot smoother.

What is a Parcel of Tied Land (POTL)?


Many people believe that a
condominium is a tall building with many units and some common amenities. 
While this is true, there are a number of other different
types of condominiums in Ontario.  One unique form of condominium
ownership is called a Common Elements Condominium (“CEC”).  With a CEC, there
is an entity called a Parcel of Tied Land or POTL.  A POTL is a freehold
parcel of land or a standard condominium unit which is tied to a share in a CEC.
  The POTL is “tied” to the share
in the CEC which means that the owner of the POTL cannot sell the POTL
without also selling its share in the CEC.  The
two interests cannot be severed.
With a POTL, each home or townhome
owner typically owns a piece of land and the building on it and also has a part
ownership in the common elements of the CEC.  The common
elements include things like parking areas, access roads, sidewalks, and parks.
As an owner of a POTL, and part owner of the common elements, you will have the
right to use the common elements facilities.  This type of ownership is
often found where there is shared ownership to a waterfront or beaches and
docks.  
As a part owner of the common
elements, you will have rights and obligations.  You will be responsible
for paying your share of the expenses related to the operation and maintenance
of the condominium’s common elements.  Like a highrise condominium, there
will be monthly common expenses or maintenance payments which will be
collected by a property management company which is responsible for the day to
day operation and administration of the
condominium corporation.
As a real estate professional, it
is important to note that when making an offer to purchase a POTL, it is
prudent to make the offer conditional on a lawyer’s review of the status
certificate and related condominium documentation.  The status certificate
and condominium documents will provide valuable information about the
condominium corporation such as the monthly common expenses, the by-laws and
any rules that are part of the condominium.  By making the offer to
purchase conditional, the Buyer will have an opportunity to review the
documents with its
lawyer to determine if there are any issues with the
condominium corporation’s finances, if there are any special assessments or
other issues that might influence one’s decision to purchase the unit.  

Finally,
realtors should be aware that there is a OREA/TREB form specifically for a POTL that
should be used when your client is purchasing a POTL.

Ending a fixed term

A fixed term tenancy ends on the day specified in the rental agreement, unless both parties agree to an early termination.

Unless the tenant and landlord make other arrangements, the tenant has to move out by noon on December 31.The landlord or tenant does not need to give notice to end a fixed term tenancy. It is courteous if the landlord or tenant provides a reminder before the end of the tenancy agreement.

A landlord may end a periodic tenancy if:the landlord or a relative of the landlord wants to move in ‘relative’ includes any relative by blood, marriage, adoption or adult interdependent relationship  the landlord agrees to sell the rental premises, all conditions of the sales agreement have been satisfied or waived and the buyer or a relative of the buyer wants to move in the buyer must ask the landlord in writing to give the tenant a notice to end the tenancy  the landlord intends to demolish the rental premises the rental premises are a detached or semi-detached dwelling or one condominium unit and the landlord agrees to sell the rental premises and all conditions of the sales agreement have been satisfied or waived in these cases, the buyer must ask the landlord in writing to give the tenant a notice to end the tenancy neither the buyer nor the buyer’s relatives have to occupy the rental premises  the landlord is an educational institution, and the tenant was a student at the beginning of the tenancy but is no longer a student the landlord intends to use or rent the rental premises for a non-residential purpose If a landlord intends to do major renovations that require the rental premises to be vacant or the landlord intends to convert the premises to a condo unit, the landlord must give the tenant one year’s notice to terminate the periodic tenancy.

However, the landlord is under no obligation to do this.Other reasons for eviction include:breaking rental agreement terms damaging the rental premises disturbing or endangering others in the rental premises  If you are experiencing any of the following issues: tenant or landlord has committed a substantial breach a tenant has assaulted or threatened to assault a landlord or tenant Learn how to deal with this issue

If the costs exceed the security deposit, the landlord can take legal action to claim for the money owing. A tenant who disagrees with deductions from the security deposit may also apply to the Residential Tenancy Dispute Resolution Service or court.Landlords cannot make deductions for damages or cleaning costs if the inspection report requirements have not been met. They can, however, take legal action to recover these costs.If there are no deductions for rent, cleaning, repairs, or other costs, such as utilities, late fees or legal fees, the landlord must pay the tenant the full deposit plus interest within 10 days of the day the tenant gave up possession of the rental premises.However, if there are deductions, the landlord must do one of the following within 10 days:return the balance of the deposit, if any, to the tenant with a statement of account that lists all the damages, repair costs, details of the cleaning charges and any fees, or give the tenant an estimate of the deductions that will be made and return any money that will not be used. The tenant must receive a final statement and any money owing within 30 days after the tenancy ends. For more detailed information, read the Information for Landlords tip sheet.

The prime rate is primarily influenced by the policy interest rate set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), also known as the BoC's target for the overnight rate. While these rates are not the same, they are closely related. When the Bank of Canada changes the target for the overnight rate, lenders will generally adjust their prime rates within a few days.

Inflation and the prime rate in Canada: September 2023 update
The pace of inflation growth is a metric thatâs closely watched by the Bank of Canada when determining the direction for its Overnight Lending Rate and, by extension, the prime rate in Canada. The central bank uses increases or decreases to its key benchmark rate as a way to control inflation growth and to keep it within its target of 2%.
Inflation in Canada has been running hot since the beginning of 2022, when the end of pandemic lockdowns and related supply-chain snarls led to considerable supply-and-demand imbalances within the economy. As well, global instability, such as the war in Ukraine, has caused energy prices to spike, which has also put upward pressure on CPI. Canadaâs rate of inflation peaked at a 40-year high in June 2022 at 8.1%. The Bank of Canadaâs rate hiking efforts have effectively pulled the measure back down, but it remains well above the Bankâs target of 2%. It came in at 4% in August, exceeding Julyâs too-high figure of 3.3%. 
While the Bank did hold rates at its last announcement on September 6, it noted that inflation remained obstinately high and reaffirmed its commitment to tamping inflation down to the 2% mark. The next CPI report for the month of September will be published in mid-October before the announcement, so we can expect that to play a major role in the Bankâs decision-making process. 
What is the prime rate?
When you apply for a loan with a variable interest rate, your lender will give you an annual interest rate thatâs tied to the bankâs prime rate. All kinds of loans are based on this rate, including certain mortgages, car loans, personal lines of credit, and even some credit cards. Think of the prime rate as the anchor these other interest rates are based on. As the prime rate in Canada moves up or down, so too does the rate of interest you pay on your loan.advertisementHow is the prime rate set in Canada?
Each bank sets its own prime rate, but the Big Five Banks usually all have the same prime rate. The prime rate is primarily influenced by the policy interest rate set by the Bank of Canada (BoC), also known as the BoC's target for the overnight rate. When the BoC raises the overnight rate, it becomes more expensive for banks to borrow money, and they raise their respective prime rates to cover the added costs. Conversely when the BoC lowers the overnight rate, banks usually lower their prime rates by the same amount. 
Is the prime rate going up in Canada?
As a result of a series of increases in the Bank of Canada's policy interest rate to control historically high inflation rates, the prime rate had also been steadily going up since the beginning of 2022 and into early 2023.
After a conditional pause in rate hikes for most of the first half of 2023, obstinately high inflation and strong Q1 GDP growth incited the Bank to once again resume rate hikes. In its June and July announcements, the Bank raised its key overnight lending rate by 0.25% twice in a row for a total of 10 rate hikes since March 2022, bringing it to 5%. As a result, the Prime rate rose to 7.2%. 
Most recently, at the Bankâs last announcement on September 6, the Bank chose to hold the target for the overnight rate at 5%, citing weak Q2 GDP figures, reduced consumer spending, a softening housing market and a more slack labour market as among the main drivers of its decision to hold rates. However, it did note that inflation remained above its 2% target, and reaffirmed its commitment to driving inflation down to the 2% mark, even if that meant effecting further rate hikes. However, it is too early to tell whether or not the Bank of Canada will need to carry out any more rate hikes in 2023. 
If it does, and the overnight lending rate goes up, so will the prime rate in Canada.
 
How does the prime rate affect mortgage rates in Canada?
There are two main types of mortgage rates in Canada â fixed and variable. When you get a fixed mortgage rate, you agree to pay the same rate over the entire course of your mortgage term regardless of what happens in the outside market. Fixed mortgages are a good option if youâre worried mortgage rates will go up, or if you want to enjoy the stability of paying the same mortgage rate until itâs time to renew.
When you get a variable mortgage rate, the rate will be expressed as the prime rate plus or minus a certain percentage. When the prime rate in Canada goes up or down, your mortgage rate will go up or down by the same amount. Variable mortgages usually come with a lower rate vs. fixed-rate mortgages when you sign up, but thereâs the risk that the rate could go up (or down) during your mortgage term. Many lenders will allow you to convert a variable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage at any time, but you will have to pay the fixed rate as of the time you decide to switch.
Letâs look at an example. If the prime rate is 3.0%, and you get a variable-rate mortgage at prime minus 0.8%, your effective interest rate will be 2.2%.
Example 1: Your original mortgage rate
prime rate - discount to prime rate = your mortgage rate
3.00% - 0.80% = 2.20% 
The prime rate can rise and fall over time, and variable-rate loans will rise and fall with it. To continue this example, if the prime rate were to increase by 0.25% to 3.25%, the interest rate on your mortgage would rise by the same amount, to 2.45%.
Example 2: Your new rate after prime rate increases during your mortgage term
new prime rate - discount to prime rate = your new mortgage rate
3.25%  - 0.80% = 2.45% (new mortgage rate)advertisementCheck out your best current mortgage ratesTake 2 minutes to answer a few questions and discover the lowest rates availableshow my ratesWhat is Canada's current prime rate?The prime rate in Canada today, October 7, 2023, is currently 7.2%.*

* The prime rate in Canada shown above is automatically checked and updated on a daily basis for accuracy. Is the prime rate in Canada going up in 2023?Between March 3, 2022 and July 12, 2023,Â  the prime rate in Canada went up by 4.50%, from 2.7% to 7.2%.
The prime lending rates of most lenders went up as a result of the Bank of Canada raising its target for the overnight rate in an effort to control high inflation. When the Bank of Canada increases its key interest rate, most banks and lenders follow suit and raise their own prime rates.Â 
In its last announcement on September 6, the Bank of Canada held the target for the overnight rate steady at 5%, citing weak Q2 GDP numbers, a slowdown in consumer spending, a softening housing market and increased slack in the labour market as the primary factors that drove its decision. However, the Bank noted that inflation has yet to come down to its target rate of 2%. In its announcement, the Bank reaffirmed its resolve to drive inflation back down to its target goal of 2%, and made it clear that it would not hesitate to effect further rate hikes if they were deemed necessary. If the Bank does choose to raise its target for the overnight rate again, we can expect the prime rate to rise with it. How is the prime rate related to the Bank of Canadaâs key interest rate?When the Bank of Canada raises its target for the overnight rate (also known as the policy interest rate or the key interest rate), it becomes more expensive for banks and lenders to borrow money; so, in turn, they raise their respective prime lending rates to cover their additional costs. Similarly, when the Bank of Canada lowers the policy interest rate, it becomes cheaper for banks and lenders to borrow money. As a result, they lower their respective prime rates accordingly. Why is TDâs mortgage prime rate higher than the mortgage prime rate of the other Big 5 Banks?In 2016, TD decided to change its mortgage prime rate independent of the Bank of Canada, increasing it by 0.15% â other banks did not follow suit. As a result, TDâs mortgage prime rate continues to be higher than the mortgage prime rate of the other Big 5 Banks.compare today's best ratesBank prime rates

           Short Term Rentals - The City’s approach to regulation
        











           Definition of a Short Term Rental
        


A short term rental is defined as the business of providing temporary accommodation for compensation, in a dwelling unit or portion of a dwelling unit for periods of up to 30 consecutive days. Businesses that have been issued a permit for a bed and breakfast are not classified as short term rentals.





           Short Term Rental business licence costs
        


As of February 1, 2020, the Business Licence Bylaw includes a two-tiered business licence category for short term rental hosts. All hosts must have a separate short term business licence for each property they rent out. Tier 2 licensees must obtain a fire inspection for the short term rental property before the business licence will be issued.
Tier 1: 1 to 4 rooms offered for rent = $100 per property
Tier 2: 5 or more rooms offered for rent = $172 per property plus the cost of a fire inspection of $104 per property











           Short Term Rentals in Secondary Suites
        


A secondary suite is a self-contained dwelling unit within principal residences or in backyards. They have separate living, cooking, sleeping, and bathroom facilities. Some hosts may choose to rent a secondary or backyard suite as a short term rental. In this case, the suite must meet the requirements for a legal secondary suite. If being used as a short term rental, the host must have a short term rental licence. For more information, visit on secondary suites Calgary.ca/suites.
Please note that secondary suites are not permitted within a dwelling unit that operates as a lodging house.

What is the new home warranty | Tarion.com

What is the new home warranty



By law, all new homes built in Ontario are provided with a warranty by the builder. Tarion’s role is to ensure that buyers of newly built homes in Ontario receive the coverage they are entitled to under their builder’s warranty





 












What it is
Coverage includes financial protection before you take possession and protection against construction defects after you take possession. 


How it works
A new home built by an HCRA licensed builder/vendor is eligible if it meets four criteria under the ONHWP Act (there must be a “home”, “vendor”, “builder”, and “owner” each of these are defined on the HCRA Website. The coverage begins when you sign the Agreement of Purchase & Sale, and remains in effect for up to 7 years even if the home is sold. Each warranty comes with certain limits and obligations on you as a home buyer and owner, as well as your vendor/builder.




Who it protects
Ontario home buyers and owners of Freehold, Contract, Condominium/Condo Conversions under 7 years old. 


Who provides the warranty
The vendor or builder pays the warranty enrolment fee to Tarion as a term and condition of an Enrolment Confirmation. For freehold homes, the fee is payable anytime before the start of construction. For condominium projects, the fee is payable at least 30 days before construction begins. 


























 






 






 








Coverage before you take possession
Your warranty coverage includes protection both before, and after you take possession of your new home. See below for an overview of the warranty coverage.Financial Protection Before You Take PossessionWarranty coverage includes financial protection before yo take possession. There are four main types of warranty coverage during this period including deposit protection, delayed closing/occupancy coverage, condominium cancellations and financial loss coverage for contract homes. For more details on coverage before you move in visit our Pre-Possession Coverage page.Coverage before you take possession
























 






 






 








Coverage After You Take Possession
Your warranty coverage includes protection both before, and after you take possession of your new home. See below for an overview of the warranty coverage.Freehold, Contract, Condo Units & Condo ConversionsCoverage for freehold, contract, condo units and condo conversions after you take possession is divided into three different time periods: 1, 2 and 7 year with each offering protection against specific items. To learn more about what’s included in these time periods, visit our coverage page for homeowners.Coverage After You Take PossessionIncidental CostsOccasionally new home owners face incidental costs as a result of authorized repairs to one or more warranted items in their new home or condominium. In such cases, Tarion may consider providing additional compensation for the incidental costs associated with moving and/or replacing items during the course of a warranted repair being done by or on behalf of Tarion.

Construction Performance Guide

The Construction Performance Guide for New Home Warranty in Alberta provides the basic requirements of warranty coverage and recommended minimum performance expectations for new homes in the province.The exclusion of an issue from the guide does not mean that it is not a defect or that a warranty provider is not responsible for addressing the issue.



Coverage limits

The new home warranty coverage limit and/or rebuild amount, as established in the Home Warranty Insurance Regulation, is set at a minimum of $265,000 for a single family home and $130,000 for a unit in a condominium or other multi-family complex. Homeowners can choose to buy additional coverage if they wish.The coverage limits are based on the average cost of rebuilding a home. This includes the structure but does not include other costs such as land, contents or landscaping.There is also up to $3.3 million in coverage for common property of each building of a multi-family project (such as, elevators, lobbies, stairwells and building envelope).

This was 13.8 per cent below the 10-year seasonal average (2,663).“It’s been an interesting spring and summer market, to say the least. Borrowing costs are fluctuating around the highest levels we’ve seen in over ten years, yet Metro Vancouver’s housing market bucked many pundits’ predictions of a major slowdown, instead posting relatively strong sales numbers and year-to-date price gains north of eight per cent, regardless of home type.” States Andrew Lis, REBGV director of economics and data analysis.There were 3,943 detached, attached and apartment properties newly listed for sale on the Multiple Listing Service® (MLS®) in Metro Vancouver in August 2023. This represents an 18.1 per cent increase compared to the 3,340 homes listed in August 2022. This was 5.3 per cent below the 10-year seasonal average (4,164).The total number of homes currently listed for sale on the MLS® system in Metro Vancouver is 10,082, a 0.2 per cent decrease compared to August 2022 (10,099). This was 13.4 per cent below the 10-year seasonal average (11,647).Across all detached, attached and apartment property types, the sales-to-active listings ratio for August 2023 is 23.9 per cent. By property type, the ratio is 14.2 per cent for detached homes, 30.3 per cent for townhomes, and 31.9 per cent for apartments.Analysis of the historical data suggests downward pressure on home prices occurs when the ratio dips below 12 per cent for a sustained period, while home prices often experience upward pressure when it surpasses 20 per cent over several months.“It’s a bit of a tortoise and hare story this year, with sales starting the year slowly while prices increased due to low inventory levels,” Lis said. “As fall approaches, sales have caught up with the price gains, but both metrics are now slowing to a pace that is more in-line with historical seasonal patterns, and with what one might expect given that borrowing costs are where they are.”The MLS® Home Price Index composite benchmark price for all residential properties in Metro Vancouver is currently $1,208,400. This represents a 2.5 per cent increase over August 2022 and a 0.2 per cent decrease compared to July 2023.Sales of detached homes in August 2023 reached 591, a 13.2 per cent increase from the 522 detached sales recorded in August 2022. The benchmark price for a detached home is $2,018,500. This represents a 3.3 per cent increase from August 2022 and a 0.3 per cent increase compared to July 2023.Sales of apartment homes reached 1,270 in August 2023, a 27.4 per cent increase compared to the 997 sales in August 2022. The benchmark price of an apartment home is $770,000. This represents a 4.4 per cent increase from August 2022 and a 0.2 per cent decrease compared to July 2023.Attached home sales in August 2023 totalled 422, an 18.9 per cent increase compared to the 355 sales in August 2022. The benchmark price of an attached home is $1,103,900. This represents a 3.9 per cent increase from August 2022 and a 0.1 per cent decrease compared to July 2023.Areas covered by the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver include: Bowen Island, Burnaby, Coquitlam, Maple Ridge, New Westminster, North Vancouver, Pitt Meadows, Port Coquitlam, Port Moody, Richmond, South Delta, Squamish, Sunshine Coast, Vancouver, West Vancouver, and Whistler.REBGV is now including multifamily and land sales and listings in this monthly report. Previously, we only included detached, attached, and apartment sales, and these additional categories, which typically account for roughly one to two per cent of total MLS® activity per month, are being included for completeness in our reporting.BOARD & ASSOCIATION INFORMATION

Let's dive deeper into the latest Canada housing market update for August 2023.CanadaCanada Market ConditionsBalancedThis Month’s SNLR: 56%An SNLR between 40% and 60% indicates a balanced market.The national average home price in August 2023 was $650,140, a 3% decrease from last month and up by 2% year-over-year. That reflects the home price trends seen in most of the provinces this month: a monthly decrease and an annual increase in home prices.Nationally, there were 38,345 home sales during the month of August 2023, almost unchanged year-over-year. Canada’s MLS Benchmark Price, which measures the price of a “typical” home in Canada, was $750,100 in August 2023. That’s only the second time that Canada’s benchmark home price has decreased on a monthly basis since the start of the year.Falling home prices, in some areas of the country, can be attributed to Bank of Canada rate hikes in both June and July 2023, resulting in a cumulative rise in interest rates by 50 basis points. This made borrowing more expensive, including the cost of mortgages, which reduces demand for homes as affordability decreases. Decreasing demand due to higher interest rates has a downward impact on Canadian home prices.For the month of August 2023, Canada’s sales-to-new-listings ratio (SNLR) was 56.2%. SNLR measures the balance between buyers and sellers in a market. A ratio below 40% is considered a buyer’s market, while an SNLR above 60% indicates a seller’s market.The current 56.2% SNLR means that there is slightly more competition among buyers for properties than what would be expected if it were an even balance between buyers and sellers, but it’s not necessarily a seller’s market yet. Instead, Canada’s SNLR has been decreasing on a monthly basis since April 2023, when it reached 67.4%.Canada: Seller’s or Buyer’s Markets?ProvinceSales-to-New-Listings Ratio (SNLR)Market TypeAlberta77%Seller’s MarketSaskatchewan72%Seller’s MarketManitoba71%Seller’s MarketOntario47%Balanced MarketQuebec60%Seller’s MarketNova Scotia73%Seller’s MarketPEI60%Seller’s MarketNewfoundland71%Seller’s MarketOntarioOntario Market ConditionsBalancedThis Month’s SNLR: 47%An SNLR between 40% and 60% indicates a balanced market.Canada’s largest housing market is on the edge of breaking even this month, as Ontario home prices hover around the same level as last year. The average home price in Ontario was $832,376 in August 2023, a 2.8% decrease since last month and 0.3% increase from last year.The average home sold price in the GTA was $1,082,496 for August 2023, representing an increase of 0.3% year-over-year but a decrease of 3% month-over-month. This means that the GTA’s performance is exactly matching the performance of the provincial average this month. GTA home sales are down 6% year-over-year, with 5,294 transactions in July. That makes up 14% of all home sales in Canada this month. That’s up from the 13% of all Canadian home sales that the GTA accounted for last month.When it comes to the housing market in Ontario, let's take a closer look at some interesting trends. Hamilton's housing market witnessed a 1% year-over-year increase in average home prices, while Brampton experienced a slight 0.5% annual decrease. Meanwhile, Oshawa saw a promising 2% rise in average home prices, while Mississauga had a 2% decrease. On the other hand, Ottawa's housing market celebrated a 1% year-over-year increase, and London experienced a solid 2% growth in average sold prices. These major cities are all seeing price movements of between -2% and 2% annually.British ColumbiaIn August 2023, the housing market in British Columbia experienced a slight decline, with home prices dropping by 1% on a monthly basis to an average home price of $958,424. However, despite this decrease, prices remained 5% higher compared to the previous year. Not surprisingly, the average BC home price is the highest in the entire country. Greater Vancouver's average home price for August 2023 was $1,283,729, up 7% year-over-year. This makes Vancouver the most expensive city to buy a home in Canada.QuebecQuebec Market ConditionsSeller's MarketThis Month’s SNLR: 60%An SNLR above 60% indicates a market that favours sellers.Quebec saw a slight decrease in home prices this month. Quebec’s average home price was $476,453 in August 2023, down 0.5% compared to last year. It’s also an annual increase of 6%.The Montreal housing market saw prices rise both on a monthly and annual basis, to $598,535 for August 2023.Atlantic CanadaNova Scotia Market ConditionsSeller's MarketThis Month’s SNLR: 73%An SNLR above 60% indicates a market that favours sellers.Atlantic Canada saw some big movements in August 2023, starting with home prices in Newfoundland reaching a record-high. At an average home price of $312,108, it’s a 2% monthly and a 4% annual increase.Home prices in New Brunswick inched upwards to $307,910, bringing New Brunswick’s annual price gain to 13%. That’s the highest annual price gain in the country this month.While Nova Scotia and PEI experienced a decline in prices compared to last month, they still remain higher year-over-year. Nova Scotia’s average home price of $418,032 is a 4% monthly decrease and an 8% annual increase. Meanwhile, Prince Edward Island’s average home price was $390,876, down 3% monthly and up 2% annually.The PrairiesAlberta Market ConditionsSeller's MarketThis Month’s SNLR: 77%An SNLR above 60% indicates a market that favours sellers.Saskatchewan was the odd one out this month, being the only province in Canada to experience both a monthly and annual decrease in home prices this month. At an average home price of $304,689 in August 2023, it’s a 1% decrease year-over-year and a 0.3% decrease from last month. Saskatoon’s average home price of $354,727 is down a significant 7% from last month and down 3% year-over-year, while Regina’s average home price of $302,401 is down 2% year-over-year and up 1% from last month.Elsewhere in the Prairies was Alberta, with an average home price of $445,190 for the month of August 2023. That’s a 4% increase year-over-year, down 2% from last month.Manitoba’s average home price of $358,167 is also up 4% year-over-year, but up by 2% from last month too.Looking at the Prairies’ major urban markets, home prices in Calgary are up 8% year-over-year to $522,548, while Edmonton home prices had a 7% annual increase to $397,811. Meanwhile, Winnipeg’s average home price is up 4% year-over-year to $382,506.Canada Real Estate Market Trends for All Property TypesBreakdown By RegionToronto Real Estate ReportBest 5-Year Fixed Mortgage Rates in Canada  Mortgage Term:1-Yr2-Yr3-Yr4-Yr5-Yr FixedVariableSee More RatesMontreal Real Estate ReportVancouver Real Estate ReportOttawa Real Estate ReportCalgary Real Estate ReportBest 5-Year Fixed Mortgage Rates in Canada  Select: Term1-Yr2-Yr3-Yr4-Yr5-Yr FixedVariableSee More RatesEdmonton Real Estate Report Winnipeg Real Estate ReportHamilton Real Estate ReportMississauga Real Estate ReportBrampton Real Estate ReportResidential Property Price IndexThe Residential Property Price Index (RPPI) is a housing price index published by Statistics Canada that measures the change over time in selling prices of residential properties. It analyzes both new and resale properties in the census metropolitan areas (CMAs) of Montréal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, and Victoria. The national composite is the weighted average of all the areas measured by the index. The index is relative to a standard of 100 set in 2017.RPPI for All Residential PropertiesPrices for residential properties in Montréal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, and Victoria continue to skyrocket as prices increase across Canada by 13.8% year-over-year in Q4 2021. The biggest increases were seen in Victoria, where home prices have risen by 18.3% compared to Q3 2019. Meanwhile, Ottawa has seen home prices increase by 16.3% year-over-year. The capital city’s housing market is expected to remain strong due to its economic stability and high availability of government jobs. Montreal and Toronto also remained hot with 14.5% and 14.6% increases respectively. Calgary, on the other hand, was the worst-performing major housing market in Canada, with a 9.3% increase in prices year-over-year.RPPI for Condominium ApartmentsAverage prices for condo apartments in Montréal, Ottawa, Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver, and Victoria increased by 8.6% in Q4 2021 compared to Q4 2020. This growth lags behind the overall average of 13.8% for all property types. The biggest increases were seen in Victoria, where prices have risen by 15.1% compared to Q4 2020. Montreal is second with year-over-year increases of 10% despite the impact of COVID-19. Even Vancouver, where properties stagnated in 2018 and 2019 due to their Empty Homes Tax and Speculation taxes, is experiencing a revival in its condo market.

Most real estate agents are part of the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), a professional association that oversees real estate markets nationally. You might be familiar with their trademarks: MLS® and Multiple Listing Service®.In Canada, there are over 130,000 real estate agents across all the provinces and territories. Ontario has the most agents out of any province with 79,000 agents across 38 local rea estate boards. Of those 79,000 agents, over 56,000 are part of the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TREB). British Columbia is second with 23,000 real estate agents and 11 real estate boards.Real estate agents are regulated on a provincial-level. Each province has their own regulatory board that sets regulations for and oversees the conduct of real estate agents in the province. In Ontario, the Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) regulates real estate transactions and helps resolve complaints against real estate agents. In B.C., the Real Estate Council of British Columbia (RECBC) regulates real estate transactions and helps resolve complaints against real estate agents. Other notable councils include RECA (Alberta), SREC (Saskatchewan), and OACIQ (Quebec).Other Real Estate StatisticsHomeownership Rate: 67.8% (2016) Vacancy Rate: 3.2% (2020) Housing ConstructionHousing Starts: 63,720 units (Q4 2020)Housing Under Construction: 292,109 units (Q4 2020)Housing Completions: 50,938 units (Q4 2020) Investment in Residential Construction: CAD $11.1 billion (Q4 2020)Investment in Non-Residential Construction: CAD $4.4 billion (Q4 2020)Average Rent for a 2-Bedroom UnitAs reported by Statistics Canada and the CMHCRegionAverage Rent for a 2-Bedroom UnitGreater Toronto Area, ON$1,622 (2020)Ottawa, ON$1,517 (2020)Vancouver, BC$1,792 (2020)Victoria, BC$1,507 (2020)Quebec City, QC$899 (2020)Montreal, QC$903 (2020)Edmonton, AB$1,272 (2020)Calgary, AB$1,323 (2020)Winnipeg, MB$1,262 (2020)Saskatoon, SK$1,166 (2020)Halifax, NS$1,255 (2020)Best 5-Year Fixed Mortgage Rates in Canada  Select: Term1-Yr2-Yr3-Yr4-Yr5-Yr FixedVariableSee More RatesGlossary and DefinitionsMLS® HPI: The MLS® Home Price Index (HPI) is an index by the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) that tracks the prices of homes in a neighborhood. It allows Canadians to quickly compare home prices across Canada and between periods of time without having to account for specific features of a property. Unlike market prices, which can fluctuate from month to month based on seasonal dynamics, the HPI provides a stable view tracks trends across a longer period of time. The HPI is reviewed every year in May to adjust for changes in the real estate marketplace.MLS® HPI Benchmark Price: The MLS® Home Price Index (HPI) Benchmark Price is the HPI translated into a real-world price number.Strata Insurance: Strata insurance is insurance used by a strata like a condominium to covers damages to common areas and assets and liability to the strata. It can also include fixtures built or installed as part of the original construction of each unit, even though these may not be common structures. The insurance can cover:Buildings and structures associated with the strata including common areas such as the roof, parking garages, driveways, gyms, pools, etc.Liability for any property damage or bodily injury suffered on strata propertyAny fixtures that are part of the "standard unit" or original construction of each unitStrata insurance does not usually include personal items and appliances that are part of a condo unit. It also does not cover the damages made by individual unit owners, such as in the case of water damage caused by a unit owner. These are usually covered by personal condo insurance.Property typesDetached home: A detached home is your standard single-family home. It is a residential building that stands alone and is separately titled or legally a single unit.Semi-detached home: A semi-detached home is similar to a detached home, except it shares a wall with another home. This pair of homes must make up an independent building and each should be separately titled or legally two separate units. There can only be two homes in a semi-detached building.Townhouses: A townhouse is the middle between a detached/semi-detached home and a condo apartment. Like detached and semi-detached homes, they are often single-family units that have their own land and may be attached to other units. However, like condo apartments, they typically have to pay co-ownership fees for maintenance and may share some common features with their neighbors.Condo apartment: This category includes all apartments and condominiums. These are complexes of residential units with common areas such as hallways, parking lots, stairwells, etc. They can be low-rise, mid-rise, or high-rise buildings. Unlike townhouses, there are no parts of the lot (the land of the building) where access is reserved for only one owner or occupant. There can be privately owned units and spaces inside the building.Plexes are multi-story buildings with two to four individual units, usually one on each floor. They are a mainstay in Montreal and other cities in Quebec. Each unit is usually individually accessible via an external entrance with higher floors connected by staircases.Property ClassesFreeholds: A freehold is any property where the owner owns both the house and the land it is built on. Common freehold property types include: detached, semi-detached, some townhouses, and farmland.Condominiums: A condominium or condo is any property where the owner owns the home (or unit) but shares ownership of the land and other improvements with a condominium corporation. Common condominium property types include condo apartments and some townhouses.Leasehold: Leasehold describes the situation where different entities own the land and the structure built on the land. Owner of the buildings has leased the land and pay rent to their landlord while owning the building on the land.Data sourced from the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) and regional real estate boards.

Chart AThe national sales figure was pulled lower in August by declines in Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley, Montreal, Ottawa, Hamilton-Burlington as well as London and St. Thomas.The actual (not seasonally adjusted) number of transactions came in 5.3% above August 2022.“With sales slowing and new listings returning to more normal levels, demand and supply are continuing to come into better balance” said Larry Cerqua, Chair of CREA. “This is giving buyers more time and more choice. If you’re looking for information and guidance about how to buy or sell a property this fall, contact a REALTOR® in your area,” continued Cerqua."August was the first full month of housing data following the Bank of Canada’s July rate hike, so a dip in activity was expected,” said Shaun Cathcart, CREA’s Senior Economist. “The demand is obviously still there, and it will be back, but as the housing affordability crisis re-emerges as a top policy issue, for now, the slowdown on the buyer side should help keep a lid on prices.”The number of newly listed homes edged up 0.8% on a month-over-month basis in August, a small increase following a cumulative gain of more than 24% between March and July. New listings started off 2023 at a 20-year low but are now closer to average levels.With sales falling and new listings edging up in August, the sales-to-new listings ratio eased to 56.2% compared to 59% in July and a peak of 67.4% in April. The measure is now back in line with its long-term average of 55.2%.There were 3.4 months of inventory on a national basis at the end of August 2023, up from 3.2 months in July. While the measure is up a bit from its recent low of 3.1 months in May and June, it remains below the second half of 2022 and well below its long-term average of about five months.The Aggregate Composite MLS® Home Price Index (HPI) edged up 0.4% on a month-over-month basis in August 2023— only about half as large as the July gain, which was only about half as large as the gains recorded in April, May, and June. This levelling off of prices is in line with slowing sales and a rebound in listings.While prices are stabilizing at the national level, regional differences are re-emerging. Price growth has remained solid in Quebec and the East Coast, followed by British Columbia and the Prairies. Ontario is now a mixed bag, still with some of the bigger increases but also some of the bigger declines.As of August 2023, the Aggregate Composite MLS® HPI was up 0.4% on a year-over-year basis. This was the first year-over-year increase since September 2022. Even though prices appear to be levelling out near current levels, year-over-year comparisons will likely continue to rise in the months ahead becauseof how prices continued to decline through the second half of 2022.
