Code Overview
Main Functions
scrape_website(url, output_file):
Accepts a URL and an output file path. Scrapes the text content from the provided URL, excludes common tags (header, footer, nav), and appends the cleaned content to the specified file.
Example
A sample websites_to_scrape list:

python
Copy
Edit
websites_to_scrape = [
    ('https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/rc4028/gst-hst-new-housing-rebate.html', 'output.md'),
    ('https://www.ratehub.ca/land-transfer-tax-rebate', 'output.md'),
]
This will scrape text from the specified URLs and append it to output.md.

Output
The scraped content is stored in the file specified (default: output.md). Each new scrape appends content to avoid overwriting existing data.

Error Handling
If a website is unreachable or returns a non-200 status code, the script prints an error message with the status code.
All exceptions are caught and logged for debugging.
Limitations
The scraper does not handle dynamic content rendered via JavaScript.
Excludes only predefined tags (header, footer, nav). For other exclusions, modify the excluded_tags list in the script.
